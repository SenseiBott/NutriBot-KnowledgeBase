      "content": "Introduction Vitamin C, also known as L-ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Humans, unlike most animals, are unable to synthesize vitamin C endogenously, so it is an essential dietary component . Vitamin C is required for the biosynthesis of collagen, L-carnitine, and certain neurotransmitters; vitamin C is also involved in protein metabolism . Collagen is an essential component of connective tissue, which plays a vital role in wound healing. Vitamin C is also an important physiological antioxidant and has been shown to regenerate other antioxidants within the body, including alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) . Ongoing research is examining whether vitamin C, by limiting the damaging effects of free radicals through its antioxidant activity, might help prevent or delay the development of certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, and other diseases in which oxidative stress plays a causal role. In addition to its biosynthetic and antioxidant functions, vitamin C plays an important role in immune function and improves the absorption of nonheme iron , the form of iron present in plant-based foods. Insufficient vitamin C intake causes scurvy, which is characterized by fatigue or lassitude, widespread connective tissue weakness, and capillary fragility [1,2,4,6-9]. The intestinal absorption of vitamin C is regulated by at least one specific dose-dependent, active transporter . Cells accumulate vitamin C via a second specific transport protein. In vitro studies have found that oxidized vitamin C, or dehydroascorbic acid, enters cells via some facilitated glucose transporters and is then reduced internally to ascorbic acid. The physiologic importance of dehydroascorbic acid uptake and its contribution to overall vitamin C economy are unknown. Oral vitamin C produces tissue and plasma concentrations that the body tightly controls. Approximately 70%–90% of vitamin C is absorbed at moderate intakes of 30–180 mg/day. However, at doses above 1 g/day, absorption falls to less than 50% and absorbed, unmetabolized ascorbic acid is excreted in the urine . Results from pharmacokinetic studies indicate that oral doses of 1.25 g/day ascorbic acid produce mean peak plasma vitamin C concentrations of 135 micromol/L, which are about two times higher than those produced by consuming 200–300 mg/day ascorbic acid from vitamin C-rich foods . Pharmacokinetic modeling predicts that even doses as high as 3 g ascorbic acid taken every 4 hours would produce peak plasma concentrations of only 220 micromol/L . The total body content of vitamin C ranges from 300 mg (at near scurvy) to about 2 g . High levels of vitamin C (millimolar concentrations) are maintained in cells and tissues and are highest in leukocytes (white blood cells), eyes, adrenal glands, pituitary gland, and brain. Relatively low levels of vitamin C (micromolar concentrations) are found in extracellular fluids, such as plasma, red blood cells, and saliva . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for vitamin C and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender , include the following: • Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals • Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA • Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals • Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Table 1 lists the current RDAs for vitamin C . The RDAs for vitamin C are based on its known physiological and antioxidant functions in white blood cells and are much higher than the amount required for protection from deficiency . For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for vitamin C that is equivalent to the mean intake of vitamin C in healthy, breastfed infants. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Vitamin C 0–6 months: Male: 40 mg*, Female: 40 mg*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 50 mg*, Female: 50 mg*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 15 mg, Female: 15 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 25 mg, Female: 25 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 45 mg, Female: 45 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 75 mg, Female: 65 mg, Pregnancy: 80 mg, Lactation: 115 mg 19+ years: Male: 90 mg, Female: 75 mg, Pregnancy: 85 mg, Lactation: 120 mg Smokers: Male: Individuals who smoke require 35 mg/day more vitamin C than nonsmokers. * Adequate Intake (AI) Sources of Vitamin C Food Fruits and vegetables are the best sources of vitamin C (see Table 2) . Citrus fruits, tomatoes and tomato juice, and potatoes are major contributors of vitamin C to the American diet . Other good food sources include red and green peppers, kiwifruit, broccoli, strawberries, Brussels sprouts, and cantaloupe (see Table 2) . Although vitamin C is not naturally present in grains, it is added to some fortified breakfast cereals. The vitamin C content of food may be reduced by prolonged storage and by cooking because ascorbic acid is water soluble and is destroyed by heat . Steaming or microwaving may lessen cooking losses. Fortunately, many of the best food sources of vitamin C, such as fruits and vegetables, are usually consumed raw. Consuming five varied servings of fruits and vegetables a day can provide more than 200 mg of vitamin C.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin C is 90 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin C content unless vitamin C has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin C arranged by nutrient content and by food name. Dietary supplements Supplements typically contain vitamin C in the form of ascorbic acid, which has equivalent bioavailability to that of naturally occurring ascorbic acid in foods, such as orange juice and broccoli [14-16]. Other forms of vitamin C supplements include sodium ascorbate; calcium ascorbate; other mineral ascorbates; ascorbic acid with bioflavonoids; and combination products, such as Ester-C, which contains calcium ascorbate, dehydroascorbate, calcium threonate, xylonate and lyxonate . A few studies in humans have examined whether bioavailability differs among the various forms of vitamin C. In one study, Ester-C and ascorbic acid produced the same vitamin C plasma concentrations, but Ester-C produced significantly higher vitamin C concentrations in leukocytes 24 hours after ingestion . Another study found no differences in plasma vitamin C levels or urinary excretion of vitamin C among three different vitamin C sources: ascorbic acid, Ester-C, and ascorbic acid with bioflavonoids . These findings, coupled with the relatively low cost of ascorbic acid, led the authors to conclude that simple ascorbic acid is the preferred source of supplemental vitamin C . Vitamin C Intakes and Status According to the 2001–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), mean intakes of vitamin C are 105.2 mg/day for adult males and 83.6 mg/day for adult females, meeting the currently established RDA for most nonsmoking adults . Mean intakes for children and adolescents age 1–18 years range from 75.6 mg/day to 100 mg/day, also meeting the RDA for these age groups . Although the 2001–2002 NHANES analysis did not include data for breastfed infants and toddlers, breastmilk is considered an adequate source of vitamin C . Use of vitamin C-containing supplements is also relatively common, adding to the total vitamin C intake from food and beverages. NHANES data from 1999–2000 indicate that approximately 35% of adults take multivitamin supplements (which typically contain vitamin C) and 12% take a separate vitamin C supplement . According to 1999–2002 NHANES data, approximately 29% of children take some form of dietary supplement that contains vitamin C . Vitamin C status is typically assessed by measuring plasma vitamin C levels . Other measures, such as leukocyte vitamin C concentration, could be more accurate indicators of tissue vitamin C levels, but they are more difficult to assess and the results are not always reliable . Vitamin C Deficiency Acute vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy . The timeline for the development of scurvy varies, depending on vitamin C body stores, but signs can appear within 1 month of little or no vitamin C intake (below 10 mg/day) . Initial symptoms can include fatigue (probably the result of impaired carnitine biosynthesis), malaise, and inflammation of the gums . As vitamin C deficiency progresses, collagen synthesis becomes impaired and connective tissues become weakened, causing petechiae, ecchymoses, purpura, joint pain, poor wound healing, hyperkeratosis, and corkscrew hairs [1,2,4,6-8]. Additional signs of scurvy include depression as well as swollen, bleeding gums and loosening or loss of teeth due to tissue and capillary fragility . Iron deficiency anemia can also occur due to increased bleeding and decreased nonheme iron absorption secondary to low vitamin C intake . In children, bone disease can be present . Left untreated, scurvy is fatal . Until the end of the 18th century, many sailors who ventured on long ocean voyages, with little or no vitamin C intake, contracted or died from scurvy. During the mid-1700s, Sir James Lind, a British Navy surgeon, conducted experiments and determined that eating citrus fruits or juices could cure scurvy, although scientists did not prove that ascorbic acid was the active component until 1932 [24-26]. Today, vitamin C deficiency and scurvy are rare in developed countries . Overt deficiency symptoms occur only if vitamin C intake falls below approximately 10 mg/day for many weeks [5-8,22,23]. Vitamin C deficiency is uncommon in developed countries but can still occur in people with limited food variety. Groups at Risk of Vitamin C Inadequacy Vitamin C inadequacy can occur with intakes that fall below the RDA but are above the amount required to prevent overt deficiency (approximately 10 mg/day). The following groups are more likely than others to be at risk of obtaining insufficient amounts of vitamin C. Smokers and passive smokers Studies consistently show that smokers have lower plasma and leukocyte vitamin C levels than nonsmokers, due in part to increased oxidative stress . For this reason, the IOM concluded that smokers need 35 mg more vitamin C per day than nonsmokers . Exposure to secondhand smoke also decreases vitamin C levels. Although the IOM was unable to establish a specific vitamin C requirement for nonsmokers who are regularly exposed to secondhand smoke, these individuals should ensure that they meet the RDA for vitamin C . Infants fed evaporated or boiled milk Most infants in developed countries are fed breastmilk and/or infant formula, both of which supply adequate amounts of vitamin C . For many reasons, feeding infants evaporated or boiled cow’s milk is not recommended. This practice can cause vitamin C deficiency because cow’s milk naturally has very little vitamin C and heat can destroy vitamin C . Individuals with limited food variety Although fruits and vegetables are the best sources of vitamin C, many other foods have small amounts of this nutrient. Thus, through a varied diet, most people should be able to meet the vitamin C RDA or at least obtain enough to prevent scurvy. People who have limited food variety—including some elderly, indigent individuals who prepare their own food; people who abuse alcohol or drugs; food faddists; people with mental illness; and, occasionally, children—might not obtain sufficient vitamin C [4,6-9,11]. People with malabsorption and certain chronic diseases Some medical conditions can reduce the absorption of vitamin C and/or increase the amount needed by the body. People with severe intestinal malabsorption or cachexia and some cancer patients might be at increased risk of vitamin C inadequacy . Low vitamin C concentrations can also occur in patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis . Vitamin C and Health Due to its function as an antioxidant and its role in immune function, vitamin C has been promoted as a means to help prevent and/or treat numerous health conditions. This section focuses on the following four diseases and disorders in which vitamin C might play a role: cancer (including prevention and treatment), cardiovascular disease, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts, and the common cold. Cancer prevention Epidemiologic evidence suggests that higher consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with lower risk of most types of cancer, perhaps, in part, due to their high vitamin C content . Vitamin C can limit the formation of carcinogens, such as nitrosamines , in vivo; modulate immune response ; and, through its antioxidant function, possibly attenuate oxidative damage that can lead to cancer . Most case-control studies have found an inverse association between dietary vitamin C intake and cancers of the lung, breast, colon or rectum, stomach, oral cavity, larynx or pharynx, and esophagus . Plasma concentrations of vitamin C are also lower in people with cancer than controls . However, evidence from prospective cohort studies is inconsistent, possibly due to varying intakes of vitamin C among studies. In a cohort of 82,234 women age 33–60 years from the Nurses’ Health Study, consumption of an average of 205 mg/day of vitamin C from food (highest quintile of intake) compared with an average of 70 mg/day (lowest quintile of intake) was associated with a 63% lower risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women with a family history of breast cancer . Conversely, Kushi and colleagues did not observe a significantly lower risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women consuming at least 198 mg/day (highest quintile of intake) of vitamin C from food compared with those consuming less than 87 mg/day (lowest quintile of intake) . A review by Carr and Frei concluded that in the majority of prospective cohort studies not reporting a significantly lower cancer risk, most participants had relatively high vitamin C intakes, with intakes higher than 86 mg/day in the lowest quintiles . Studies reporting significantly lower cancer risk found these associations in individuals with vitamin C intakes of at least 80–110 mg/day, a range associated with close to vitamin C tissue saturation . Evidence from most randomized clinical trials suggests that vitamin C supplementation, usually in combination with other micronutrients, does not affect cancer risk. In the Supplémentation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants (SU.VI.MAX) study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial,13,017 healthy French adults received antioxidant supplementation with 120 mg ascorbic acid, 30 mg vitamin E, 6 mg beta-carotene, 100 mcg selenium, and 20 mg zinc, or placebo . After a median follow-up time of 7.5 years, antioxidant supplementation lowered total cancer incidence in men but not in women. In addition, baseline antioxidant status was related to cancer risk in men but not in women . Supplements of 500 mg/day vitamin C plus 400 International Units (IU) vitamin E every other day for a mean follow-up period of 8 years failed to reduce the risk of prostate or total cancer compared with placebo in middle-aged and older men participating in the Physicians’ Health Study II . Similar findings were reported in women participating in the Women’s Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study . Compared with placebo, supplementation with vitamin C (500 mg/day) for an average of 9.4 years had no significant effect on total cancer incidence or cancer mortality. In a large intervention trial conducted in Linxian, China, daily supplements of vitamin C (120 mg) plus molybdenum (30 mcg) for 5–6 years did not significantly affect the risk of developing esophageal or gastric cancer . Moreover, during 10 years of follow-up, this supplementation regimen failed to significantly affect total morbidity or mortality from esophageal, gastric, or other cancers . A 2008 review of vitamin C and other antioxidant supplements for the prevention of gastrointestinal cancers found no convincing evidence that vitamin C (or beta-carotene, vitamin A, or vitamin E) prevents gastrointestinal cancers . A similar review by Coulter and colleagues found that vitamin C supplementation, in combination with vitamin E, had no significant effect on death risk due to cancer in healthy individuals . At this time, the evidence is inconsistent on whether dietary vitamin C intake affects cancer risk. Results from most clinical trials suggest that modest vitamin C supplementation alone or with other nutrients offers no benefit in the prevention of cancer. A substantial limitation in interpreting many of these studies is that investigators did not measure vitamin C concentrations before or after supplementation. Plasma and tissue concentrations of vitamin C are tightly controlled in humans. At daily intakes of 100 mg or higher, cells appear to be saturated and at intakes of at least 200 mg, plasma concentrations increase only marginally . If subjects’ vitamin C levels were already close to saturation at study entry, supplementation would be expected to have made little or no difference on measured outcomes . Cancer treatment During the 1970s, studies by Cameron, Campbell, and Pauling suggested that high-dose vitamin C has beneficial effects on quality of life and survival time in patients with terminal cancer . However, some subsequent studies—including a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial by Moertel and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic —did not support these findings. In the Moertel study, patients with advanced colorectal cancer who received 10 g/day vitamin C fared no better than those receiving a placebo. The authors of a 2003 review assessing the effects of vitamin C in patients with advanced cancer concluded that vitamin C confers no significant mortality benefit . Emerging research suggests that the route of vitamin C administration (intravenous [IV] vs. oral) could explain the conflicting findings . Most intervention trials, including the one conducted by Moertel and colleagues, used only oral administration, whereas Cameron and colleagues used a combination of oral and IV administration. Oral administration of vitamin C, even of very large doses, can raise plasma vitamin C concentrations to a maximum of only 220 micromol/L, whereas IV administration can produce plasma concentrations as high as 26,000 micromol/L . Concentrations of this magnitude are selectively cytotoxic to tumor cells in vitro . Research in mice suggests that pharmacologic doses of IV vitamin C might show promise in treating otherwise difficult-to-treat tumors . A high concentration of vitamin C may act as a pro-oxidant and generate hydrogen peroxide that has selective toxicity toward cancer cells [49-51]. Based on these findings and a few case reports of patients with advanced cancers who had remarkably long survival times following administration of high-dose IV vitamin C, some researchers support reassessment of the use of high-dose IV vitamin C as a drug to treat cancer . As discussed below, it is uncertain whether supplemental vitamin C and other antioxidants might interact with chemotherapy and/or radiation . Therefore, individuals undergoing these procedures should consult with their oncologist prior to taking vitamin C or other antioxidant supplements, especially in high doses . Cardiovascular disease Evidence from many epidemiological studies suggests that high intakes of fruits and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease . This association might be partly attributable to the antioxidant content of these foods because oxidative damage, including oxidative modification of low-density lipoproteins, is a major cause of cardiovascular disease . In addition to its antioxidant properties, vitamin C has been shown to reduce monocyte adherence to the endothelium, improve endothelium-dependent nitric oxide production and vasodilation, and reduce vascular smooth-muscle-cell apoptosis, which prevents plaque instability in atherosclerosis . Results from prospective studies examining associations between vitamin C intake and cardiovascular disease risk are conflicting . In the Nurses’ Health Study, a 16-year prospective study involving 85,118 female nurses, total intake of vitamin C from both dietary and supplemental sources was inversely associated with coronary heart disease risk . However, intake of vitamin C from diet alone showed no significant associations, suggesting that vitamin C supplement users might be at lower risk of coronary heart disease. A much smaller study indicated that postmenopausal women with diabetes who took at least 300 mg/day vitamin C supplements had increased cardiovascular disease mortality . A prospective study in 20,649 British adults found that those in the top quartile of baseline plasma vitamin C concentrations had a 42% lower risk of stroke than those in the bottom quartile . In male physicians participating in the Physicians’ Health Study, use of vitamin C supplements for a mean of 5.5 years was not associated with a significant decrease in total cardiovascular disease mortality or coronary heart disease mortality . A pooled analysis of nine prospective studies that included 293,172 subjects free of coronary heart disease at baseline found that people who took ≥700 mg/day of supplemental vitamin C had a 25% lower risk of coronary heart disease incidence than those who took no supplemental vitamin C . The authors of a 2008 meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, including 14 studies reporting on vitamin C for a median follow-up of 10 years, concluded that dietary, but not supplemental, intake of vitamin C is inversely associated with coronary heart disease risk . Results from most clinical intervention trials have failed to show a beneficial effect of vitamin C supplementation on the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. In the Women’s Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study, a secondary prevention trial involving 8,171 women age 40 years or older with a history of cardiovascular disease, supplementation with 500 mg/day vitamin C for a mean of 9.4 years showed no overall effect on cardiovascular events . Similarly, vitamin C supplementation (500 mg/day) for a mean follow-up of 8 years had no effect on major cardiovascular events in male physicians enrolled in the Physicians’ Health Study II . Other clinical trials have generally examined the effects on cardiovascular disease of supplements combining vitamin C with other antioxidants, such as vitamin E and beta-carotene, making it more difficult to isolate the potential contribution of vitamin C. The SU.VI.MAX study examined the effects of a combination of vitamin C (120 mg/day), vitamin E (30 mg/day), beta-carotene (6 mg/day), selenium (100 mcg/day), and zinc (20 mg/day) in 13,017 French adults from the general population . After a median follow-up time of 7.5 years, the combined supplements had no effect on ischemic cardiovascular disease in either men or women. In the Women’s Angiographic Vitamin and Estrogen study, involving 423 postmenopausal women with at least one coronary stenosis of 15%–75%, supplements of 500 mg vitamin C plus 400 IU vitamin E twice per day not only provided no cardiovascular benefit, but significantly increased all-cause mortality compared with placebo . The authors of a 2006 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that antioxidant supplements (vitamins C and E and beta-carotene or selenium) do not affect the progression of atherosclerosis . Similarly, a systematic review of vitamin C’s effects on the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease found that vitamin C did not have favorable effects on cardiovascular disease prevention . Since then, researchers have published follow-up data from the Linxian trial, a population nutrition intervention trial conducted in China . In this trial, daily vitamin C supplements (120 mg) plus molybdenum (30 mcg) for 5–6 years significantly reduced the risk of cerebrovascular deaths by 8% during 10 years of follow-up after the end of the active intervention. Although the Linxian trial data suggest a possible benefit, overall, the findings from most intervention trials do not provide convincing evidence that vitamin C supplements provide protection against cardiovascular disease or reduce its morbidity or mortality. However, as discussed in the cancer prevention section, clinical trial data for vitamin C are limited by the fact that plasma and tissue concentrations of vitamin C are tightly controlled in humans. If subjects’ vitamin C levels were already close to saturation at study entry, supplementation would be expected to have made little or no difference on measured outcomes . Age-related macular degeneration and cataracts Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts are two of the leading causes of vision loss in older individuals. Oxidative stress might contribute to the etiology of both conditions. Thus, researchers have hypothesized that vitamin C and other antioxidants play a role in the development and/or treatment of these diseases. A population-based cohort study in the Netherlands found that adults age 55 years or older who had high dietary intakes of vitamin C as well as beta-carotene, zinc, and vitamin E had a reduced risk of AMD . However, most prospective studies do not support these findings . The authors of a 2007 systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies and randomized clinical trials concluded that the current evidence does not support a role for vitamin C and other antioxidants, including antioxidant supplements, in the primary prevention of early AMD . Although research has not shown that antioxidants play a role in AMD development, some evidence suggests that they might help slow AMD progression . The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, evaluated the effect of high doses of selected antioxidants (500 mg vitamin C, 400 IU vitamin E, 15 mg beta-carotene, 80 mg zinc, and 2 mg copper) on the development of advanced AMD in 3,597 older individuals with varying degrees of AMD . After an average follow-up period of 6.3 years, participants at high risk of developing advanced AMD (i.e., those with intermediate AMD or those with advanced AMD in one eye) who received the antioxidant supplements had a 28% lower risk of progression to advanced AMD than participants who received a placebo. A follow-up AREDS2 study confirmed the value of this and similar supplement formulations in reducing the progression of AMD over a median follow-up period of 5 years . High dietary intakes of vitamin C and higher plasma ascorbate concentrations have been associated with a lower risk of cataract formation in some studies . In a 5-year prospective cohort study conducted in Japan, higher dietary vitamin C intake was associated with a reduced risk of developing cataracts in a cohort of more than 30,000 adults age 45–64 years . Results from two case-control studies indicate that vitamin C intakes greater than 300 mg/day reduce the risk of cataract formation by 70%–75% . Use of vitamin C supplements, on the other hand, was associated with a 25% higher risk of age-related cataract extraction among a cohort of 24,593 Swedish women age 49–83 years . These findings applied to study participants who took relatively high-dose vitamin C supplements (approximately 1,000 mg/day) and not to those who took multivitamins containing substantially less vitamin C (approximately 60 mg/day). Data from clinical trials are limited. In one study, Chinese adults who took daily supplements of 120 mg vitamin C plus 30 mcg molybdenum for 5 years did not have a significantly lower cataract risk . However, adults age 65–74 years who received 180 mg vitamin C plus 30 mcg molybdenum combined with other nutrients in a multivitamin/mineral supplement had a 43% significantly lower risk of developing nuclear cataracts than those who received a placebo . In the AREDS study, older individuals who received supplements of 500 mg vitamin C, 400 IU vitamin E, and 15 mg beta-carotene for an average of 6.3 years did not have a significantly lower risk of developing cataracts or of cataract progression than those who received a placebo . The AREDS2 study, which also tested formulations containing 500 mg vitamin C, confirmed these findings . Overall, the currently available evidence does not indicate that vitamin C, taken alone or with other antioxidants, affects the risk of developing AMD, although some evidence indicates that the AREDS formulations might slow AMD progression in people at high risk of developing advanced AMD. The common cold In the 1970s Linus Pauling suggested that vitamin C could successfully treat and/or prevent the common cold . Results of subsequent controlled studies have been inconsistent, resulting in confusion and controversy, although public interest in the subject remains high . A 2007 Cochrane Review examined placebo-controlled trials involving the use of at least 200 mg/day vitamin C taken either continuously as a prophylactic treatment or after the onset of cold symptoms . Prophylactic use of vitamin C did not significantly reduce the risk of developing a cold in the general population. However, in trials involving marathon runners, skiers, and soldiers exposed to extreme physical exercise and/or cold environments, prophylactic use of vitamin C in doses ranging from 250 mg/day to 1 g/day reduced cold incidence by 50%. In the general population, use of prophylactic vitamin C modestly reduced cold duration by 8% in adults and 14% in children. When taken after the onset of cold symptoms, vitamin C did not affect cold duration or symptom severity. Overall, the evidence to date suggests that regular intakes of vitamin C at doses of at least 200 mg/day do not reduce the incidence of the common cold in the general population, but such intakes might be helpful in people exposed to extreme physical exercise or cold environments and those with marginal vitamin C status, such as the elderly and chronic smokers [81-83]. The use of vitamin C supplements might shorten the duration of the common cold and ameliorate symptom severity in the general population , possibly due to the antihistamine effect of high-dose vitamin C . However, taking vitamin C after the onset of cold symptoms does not appear to be beneficial . Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin C Vitamin C has low toxicity and is not believed to cause serious adverse effects at high intakes . The most common complaints are diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramps, and other gastrointestinal disturbances due to the osmotic effect of unabsorbed vitamin C in the gastrointestinal tract . In postmenopausal women with diabetes who participated in the Iowa Women’s Health Study, supplemental (but not dietary) vitamin C intake (at least 300 mg/day) was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality . The mechanism for this effect, if real, is not clear and this finding is from a subgroup of patients in an epidemiological study. No such association has been observed in any other epidemiological study, so the significance of this finding is uncertain. High vitamin C intakes also have the potential to increase urinary oxalate and uric acid excretion, which could contribute to the formation of kidney stones, especially in individuals with renal disorders . However, studies evaluating the effects on urinary oxalate excretion of vitamin C intakes ranging from 30 mg to 10 g/day have had conflicting results, so it is not clear whether vitamin C actually plays a role in the development of kidney stones [8,85-87]. The best evidence that vitamin C contributes to kidney stone formation is in patients with pre-existing hyperoxaluria . Due to the enhancement of nonheme iron absorption by vitamin C, a theoretical concern is that high vitamin C intakes might cause excess iron absorption. In healthy individuals, this does not appear to be a concern . However, in individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis, chronic consumption of high doses of vitamin C could exacerbate iron overload and result in tissue damage . Under certain conditions, vitamin C can act as a pro-oxidant, potentially contributing to oxidative damage . A few studies in vitro have suggested that by acting as a pro-oxidant, supplemental oral vitamin C could cause chromosomal and/or DNA damage and possibly contribute to the development of cancer . However, other studies have not shown increased oxidative damage or increased cancer risk with high intakes of vitamin C . Other reported effects of high intakes of vitamin C include reduced vitamin B12 and copper levels, accelerated metabolism or excretion of ascorbic acid, erosion of dental enamel, and allergic responses . However, at least some of these conclusions were a consequence of assay artifact, and additional studies have not confirmed these observations . The FNB has established ULs for vitamin C that apply to both food and supplement intakes (Table 3) . Long-term intakes of vitamin C above the UL may increase the risk of adverse health effects. The ULs do not apply to individuals receiving vitamin C for medical treatment, but such individuals should be under the care of a physician . Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Vitamin C 0–12 months: Male: Not possible to establish*, Female: Not possible to establish*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 400 mg, Female: 400 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 650 mg, Female: 650 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 1,200 mg, Female: 1,200 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 1,800 mg, Female: 1,800 mg, Pregnancy: 1,800 mg, Lactation: 1,800 mg 19+ years: Male: 2,000 mg, Female: 2,000 mg, Pregnancy: 2,000 mg, Lactation: 2,000 mg *Formula and food should be the only sources of vitamin C for infants. Interactions with Medications Vitamin C supplements have the potential to interact with several types of medications. A few examples are provided below. Individuals taking these medications on a regular basis should discuss their vitamin C intakes with their health care providers. Chemotherapy and radiation The safety and efficacy of the use of vitamin C and other antioxidants during cancer treatment is controversial . Some data indicate that antioxidants might protect tumor cells from the action of radiation therapy and chemotherapeutic agents, such as cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, carmustine, busulfan, thiotepa, and doxorubicin . At least some of these data have been criticized because of poor study design . Other data suggest that antioxidants might protect normal tissues from chemotherapy- and radiation-induced damage and/or enhance the effectiveness of conventional cancer treatment . However, due to the physiologically tight control of vitamin C, it is unclear whether oral vitamin C supplements could alter vitamin C concentrations enough to produce the suggested effects. Individuals undergoing chemotherapy or radiation should consult with their oncologist prior to taking vitamin C or other antioxidant supplements, especially in high doses . 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) Vitamin C, in combination with other antioxidants, may attenuate the increase in high-density lipoprotein levels resulting from combination niacin–simvastatin (Zocor) therapy . It is not known whether this interaction occurs with other lipid-altering regimens . Health care providers should monitor lipid levels in individuals taking both statins and antioxidant supplements . Vitamin C and Healthful Diets The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that “Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. … In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).” For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA’s MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that • Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Fruits, particularly citrus fruits, fruit juices, and many vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin C. • Fruits, particularly citrus fruits, fruit juices, and many vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin C. • Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. • Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. • Limits alcoholic beverages. • Stays within your daily calorie needs. • Fruits, particularly citrus fruits, fruit juices, and many vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with vitamin C."

      "content": "Introduction Vitamin E is found naturally in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. Vitamin E is the collective name for a group of fat-soluble compounds with distinctive antioxidant activities . Naturally occurring vitamin E exists in eight chemical forms (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol and alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienol) that have varying levels of biological activity . Alpha- (or α-) tocopherol is the only form that is recognized to meet human requirements. Serum concentrations of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) depend on the liver, which takes up the nutrient after the various forms are absorbed from the small intestine. The liver preferentially resecretes only alpha-tocopherol via the hepatic alpha-tocopherol transfer protein ; the liver metabolizes and excretes the other vitamin E forms . As a result, blood and cellular concentrations of other forms of vitamin E are lower than those of alpha-tocopherol and have been the subjects of less research . Antioxidants protect cells from the damaging effects of free radicals, which are molecules that contain an unshared electron. Free radicals damage cells and might contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease and cancer . Unshared electrons are highly energetic and react rapidly with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species (ROS). The body forms ROS endogenously when it converts food to energy, and antioxidants might protect cells from the damaging effects of ROS. The body is also exposed to free radicals from environmental exposures, such as cigarette smoke, air pollution, and ultraviolet radiation from the sun. ROS are part of signaling mechanisms among cells. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant that stops the production of ROS formed when fat undergoes oxidation. Scientists are investigating whether, by limiting free-radical production and possibly through other mechanisms, vitamin E might help prevent or delay the chronic diseases associated with free radicals. In addition to its activities as an antioxidant, vitamin E is involved in immune function and, as shown primarily by in vitro studies of cells, cell signaling, regulation of gene expression, and other metabolic processes . Alpha-tocopherol inhibits the activity of protein kinase C, an enzyme involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle cells, platelets, and monocytes . Vitamin-E-replete endothelial cells lining the interior surface of blood vessels are better able to resist blood cell components adhering to this surface. Vitamin E also increases the expression of two enzymes that suppress arachidonic acid metabolism, thereby increasing the release of prostacyclin from the endothelium, which, in turn, dilates blood vessels and inhibits platelet aggregation . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for vitamin E and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of The National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used to plan and assess nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and gender, include the following: • Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals • Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA • Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals • Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects The FNB’s vitamin E recommendations are for alpha-tocopherol alone, the only form maintained in plasma. The FNB based these recommendations primarily on serum levels of the nutrient that provide adequate protection in a test measuring the survival of erythrocytes when exposed to hydrogen peroxide, a free radical . Acknowledging great uncertainties in these data, the FNB has called for research to identify other biomarkers for assessing vitamin E requirements. Naturally sourced vitamin E is called RRR-alpha-tocopherol (commonly labeled as d-alpha-tocopherol); the synthetically produced form is all rac-alpha-tocopherol (commonly labeled as dl-alpha-tocopherol). RDAs for vitamin E are provided in milligrams (mg) and are listed in Table 1. One mg vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is equivalent to 1 mg RRR-alpha-tocopherol or 2 mg all rac-alpha-tocopherol. Because insufficient data are available to develop RDAs for infants, AIs were developed based on the amount of vitamin E consumed by healthy breastfed babies. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Vitamin E (Alpha-Tocopherol) 0–6 months*: Males: 4 mg, Females: 4 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months*: Males: 5 mg, Females: 5 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Males: 6 mg, Females: 6 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Males: 7 mg, Females: 7 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Males: 11 mg, Females: 11 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14+ years: Males: 15 mg, Females: 15 mg, Pregnancy: 15 mg, Lactation: 19 mg *Adequate Intake (AI) International Units and Milligrams Vitamin E is listed on the new Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts labels in mg . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required manufacturers to use these new labels starting in January 2020, but companies with annual sales of less than $10 million were allowed to use the old labels that list vitamin E in International Units (IUs) until January 2021 . Conversion rules are as follows: • To convert from mg to IU: 1 mg of alpha-tocopherol is equivalent to 1.49 IU of the natural form or 2.22 IU of the synthetic form. • 1 mg of alpha-tocopherol is equivalent to 1.49 IU of the natural form or 2.22 IU of the synthetic form. • To convert from IU to mg: 1 IU of the natural form is equivalent to 0.67 mg of alpha-tocopherol. ​​​​​​​1 IU of the synthetic form is equivalent to 0.45 mg of alpha-tocopherol. • 1 IU of the natural form is equivalent to 0.67 mg of alpha-tocopherol. • ​​​​​​​1 IU of the synthetic form is equivalent to 0.45 mg of alpha-tocopherol. • 1 mg of alpha-tocopherol is equivalent to 1.49 IU of the natural form or 2.22 IU of the synthetic form. • 1 IU of the natural form is equivalent to 0.67 mg of alpha-tocopherol. • ​​​​​​​1 IU of the synthetic form is equivalent to 0.45 mg of alpha-tocopherol. For example, 15 mg of natural alpha-tocopherol would equal 22.4 IU (15 mg x 1.49 IU/mg = 22.4 IU). The corresponding value for synthetic alpha-tocopherol would be 33.3 IU (15 mg x 2.22 IU/mg). Sources of Vitamin E Food Numerous foods provide vitamin E. Nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils are among the best sources of alpha-tocopherol, and significant amounts are available in green leafy vegetables and fortified cereals (see Table 2 for a more detailed list) . Most vitamin E in American diets is in the form of gamma-tocopherol from soybean, canola, corn, and other vegetable oils and food products . Table 2: Vitamin E (Alpha-Tocopherol) Content of Selected Foods Wheat germ oil, 1 tablespoon: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 20.3, Percent DV*: 135 Sunflower seeds, dry roasted, 1 ounce: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 7.4, Percent DV*: 49 Almonds, dry roasted, 1 ounce: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 6.8, Percent DV*: 45 Sunflower oil, 1 tablespoon: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 5.6, Percent DV*: 37 Safflower oil, 1 tablespoon: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 4.6, Percent DV*: 31 Hazelnuts, dry roasted, 1 ounce: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 4.3, Percent DV*: 29 Peanut butter, 2 tablespoons: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 2.9, Percent DV*: 19 Peanuts, dry roasted, 1 ounce: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 2.2, Percent DV*: 15 Corn oil, 1 tablespoon: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 1.9, Percent DV*: 13 Spinach, boiled, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 1.9, Percent DV*: 13 Broccoli, chopped, boiled, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 1.2, Percent DV*: 8 Soybean oil, 1 tablespoon: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 1.1, Percent DV*: 7 Kiwifruit, 1 medium: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 1.1, Percent DV*: 7 Mango, sliced, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 0.7, Percent DV*: 5 Tomato, raw, 1 medium: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 0.7, Percent DV*: 5 Spinach, raw, 1 cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 0.6, Percent DV*: 4 *DV = Daily Value. FDA developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for vitamin E is 15 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older . One mg vitamin E = 1 mg RRR-alpha-tocopherol = 2 mg all rac-alpha-tocopherol. FDA does not require food labels to list vitamin E content unless vitamin E has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central website lists the nutrient content of many foods, including, in some cases, the amounts of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol. The USDA also provides a comprehensive list of foods containing vitamin E arranged by nutrient content and by food name. Dietary supplements Supplements of vitamin E typically provide only alpha-tocopherol, although mixed products containing other tocopherols and even tocotrienols are available. Naturally occurring alpha-tocopherol exists in one stereoisomeric form. In contrast, synthetically produced alpha-tocopherol contains equal amounts of its eight possible stereoisomers; serum and tissues maintain only four of these stereoisomers . A given amount of synthetic alpha-tocopherol (all rac-alpha-tocopherol; commonly labeled as DL or dl) is therefore only half as active as the same amount (by weight in mg) of the natural form (RRR-alpha-tocopherol; commonly labeled as D or d). Most vitamin-E-only supplements provide ≥67 mg (100 IU of natural vitamin E) of the nutrient. These amounts are substantially higher than the RDAs. Alpha-tocopherol in dietary supplements and fortified foods is often esterified to prolong its shelf life while protecting its antioxidant properties. The body hydrolyzes and absorbs these esters (alpha-tocopheryl acetate and succinate) as efficiently as alpha-tocopherol . Vitamin E Intakes and Status Three national surveys—the 2001–2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) , NHANES III (1988–1994) , and the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (1994–1996) —have found that the diets of most Americans provide less than the RDA levels of vitamin E. These intake estimates might be low, however, because the amounts and types of fat added during cooking are often unknown and not accounted for . The FNB suggests that mean intakes of vitamin E among healthy adults are probably higher than the RDA but cautions that low-fat diets might provide insufficient amounts unless people make their food choices carefully by, for example, increasing their intakes of nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables . The 1999–2000 NHANES found that 11.3% of adults took vitamin E supplements containing at least 400 IU . Vitamin E Deficiency Frank vitamin E deficiency is rare and overt deficiency symptoms have not been found in healthy people who obtain little vitamin E from their diets . Premature babies of very low birth weight (<1,500 grams) might be deficient in vitamin E. Vitamin E supplementation in these infants might reduce the risk of some complications, such as those affecting the retina, but they can also increase the risk of infections . Because the digestive tract requires fat to absorb vitamin E, people with fat-malabsorption disorders are more likely to become deficient than people without such disorders. Deficiency symptoms include peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, skeletal myopathy, retinopathy, and impairment of the immune response . People with Crohn’s disease, cystic fibrosis, or an inability to secrete bile from the liver into the digestive tract, for example, often pass greasy stools or have chronic diarrhea; as a result, they sometimes require water-soluble forms of vitamin E, such as tocopheryl polyethylene glycol-1000 succinate . Some people with abetalipoproteinemia, a rare inherited disorder resulting in poor absorption of dietary fat, require enormous doses of supplemental vitamin E (approximately 100 mg/kg or 5–10 g/day) . Vitamin E deficiency secondary to abetalipoproteinemia causes such problems as poor transmission of nerve impulses, muscle weakness, and retinal degeneration that leads to blindness . Ataxia and vitamin E deficiency (AVED) is another rare, inherited disorder in which the liver’s alpha-tocopherol transfer protein is defective or absent. People with AVED have such severe vitamin E deficiency that they develop nerve damage and lose the ability to walk unless they take large doses of supplemental vitamin E . Vitamin E and Health Many claims have been made about vitamin E’s potential to promote health and prevent and treat disease. The mechanisms by which vitamin E might provide this protection include its function as an antioxidant and its roles in anti-inflammatory processes, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and immune enhancement. A primary barrier to characterizing the roles of vitamin E in health is the lack of validated biomarkers for vitamin E intake and status to help relate intakes to valid predictors of clinical outcomes . This section focuses on four diseases and disorders in which vitamin E might be involved: heart disease, cancer, eye disorders, and cognitive decline. Coronary heart disease Evidence that vitamin E could help prevent or delay coronary heart disease (CHD) comes from several sources. In vitro studies have found that the nutrient inhibits oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, thought to be a crucial initiating step for atherosclerosis . Vitamin E might also help prevent the formation of blood clots that could lead to a heart attack or venous thromboembolism . Several observational studies have associated lower rates of heart disease with higher vitamin E intakes. One study of approximately 90,000 nurses found that the incidence of heart disease was 30% to 40% lower in those with the highest intakes of vitamin E, primarily from supplements . Among a group of 5,133 Finnish men and women followed for a mean of 14 years, higher vitamin E intakes from food were associated with decreased mortality from CHD . However, randomized clinical trials cast doubt on the efficacy of vitamin E supplements to prevent CHD . For example, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study, which followed almost 10,000 patients at high risk of heart attack or stroke for 4.5 years , found that participants taking 400 IU/day of natural vitamin E (268 mg) experienced no fewer cardiovascular events or hospitalizations for heart failure or chest pain than participants taking a placebo. In the HOPE-TOO follow-up study, almost 4,000 of the original participants continued to take vitamin E or placebo for an additional 2.5 years . HOPE-TOO found that vitamin E provided no significant protection against heart attacks, strokes, unstable angina, or deaths from cardiovascular disease or other causes after 7 years of treatment. Participants taking vitamin E, however, were 13% more likely to experience, and 21% more likely to be hospitalized for, heart failure, a statistically significant but unexpected finding not reported in other large studies. The HOPE and HOPE-TOO trials provide compelling evidence that moderately high doses of vitamin E supplements do not reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular events among men and women >50 years of age with established heart disease or diabetes . These findings are supported by evidence from the Women’s Angiographic Vitamin and Estrogen study, in which 423 postmenopausal women with some degree of coronary stenosis took supplements with 400 IU vitamin E (form not specified) and 500 mg vitamin C twice a day or placebo for >4 years . Not only did the supplements provide no cardiovascular benefits, but all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the women taking the supplements. The latest published clinical trial of vitamin E’s effects on the heart and blood vessels of women included almost 40,000 healthy women ≥45 years of age who were randomly assigned to receive either 600 IU of natural vitamin E (402 mg) on alternate days or placebo and who were followed for an average of 10 years . The investigators found no significant differences in rates of overall cardiovascular events (combined nonfatal heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular deaths) or all-cause mortality between the groups. However, the study did find two positive and significant results for women taking vitamin E: they had a 24% reduction in cardiovascular death rates, and those ≥65 years of age had a 26% decrease in nonfatal heart attack and a 49% decrease in cardiovascular death rates. The most recent published clinical trial of vitamin E and men’s cardiovascular health included almost 15,000 healthy physicians ≥50 years of age who were randomly assigned to receive 400 IU synthetic alpha-tocopherol (180 mg) every other day, 500 mg vitamin C daily, both vitamins, or placebo . During a mean follow-up period of 8 years, intake of vitamin E (and/or vitamin C) had no effect on the incidence of major cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular morality. Furthermore, use of vitamin E was associated with a significantly increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. In general, clinical trials have not provided evidence that routine use of vitamin E supplements prevents cardiovascular disease or reduces its morbidity and mortality. However, participants in these studies have been largely middle-aged or elderly individuals with demonstrated heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. Some researchers have suggested that understanding the potential utility of vitamin E in preventing CHD might require longer studies in younger participants taking higher doses of the supplement . Further research is needed to determine whether supplemental vitamin E has any protective value for younger, healthier people at no obvious risk of CHD. Cancer Antioxidant nutrients like vitamin E protect cell constituents from the damaging effects of free radicals that, if unchecked, might contribute to cancer development . Vitamin E might also block the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines formed in the stomach from nitrites in foods and protect against cancer by enhancing immune function . Unfortunately, human trials and surveys that have attempted to associate vitamin E intake with cancer incidence have found that vitamin E is not beneficial in most cases. Both the HOPE-TOO Trial and Women’s Health Study evaluated whether vitamin E supplements might protect people from cancer. HOPE-TOO, which followed men and women ≥55 years of age with heart disease or diabetes for 7 years, found no significant differences in the number of new cancers or cancer deaths between individuals randomly assigned to take 400 IU/day of natural vitamin E (268 mg) or a placebo . In the Women’s Health Study, in which healthy women ≥45 years of age received either 600 IU of natural vitamin E (402 mg) every other day or a placebo for 10 years, the supplement did not reduce the risk of developing any form of cancer . Several studies have examined whether vitamin E intake and/or supplemental vitamin E affects the risk of developing prostate cancer. A prospective cohort study of >29,000 men found no association between dietary or supplemental vitamin E intake and prostate cancer risk . However, among current smokers and men who had quit, vitamin E intakes of more than 400 IU/day (form not specified) were associated with a statistically significant 71% reduction in the risk of advanced prostate cancer. In a clinical trial involving 29,133 male smokers, men randomly assigned to take daily supplements of 111 IU of synthetic vitamin E (50 mg, as dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate) for 5–8 years had 32% fewer prostate cancers compared to subjects who did not take the supplements . Based in part on the promising results of this study, a large randomized clinical trial, called the SELECT trial, began in 2001 to determine whether 7–12 years of daily supplementation with 400 IU of synthetic vitamin E (180 mg, as dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate), with or without selenium (200 mcg, as L-selenomethionine), reduced the number of new prostate cancers in 35,533 healthy men age 50 and older. The trial was discontinued in October 2008 when an analysis found that the supplements, taken alone or together for about 5.5 years, did not prevent prostate cancer . Results from an additional 1.5 years of follow-up from this trial (during which the subjects no longer received vitamin E or selenium), showed that the men who had taken the vitamin E had a 17% increased risk of prostate cancer compared to men only taking placebos, a statistically significant difference . The risk of developing prostate cancer was also slightly increased in subjects taking vitamin E plus selenium or selenium alone, but the differences were not statistically significant. No differences were found among groups in the incidence of lung or colorectal cancers or all cancers combined. Study staff members will continue to monitor participants’ health for up to 5 more years. The National Cancer Institute website provides additional information on the SELECT trial. One study of women in Iowa provides evidence that higher intakes of vitamin E from foods and supplements could decrease the risk of colon cancer, especially in women <65 years of age . The overall relative risk for the highest quintile of intake (>35.7 IU/day, form not specified) compared to the lowest quintile (<5.7 IU/day, form not specified) was 0.32. However, prospective cohort studies of 87,998 women in the Nurses’ Health Study and 47,344 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study failed to replicate these results . Although some research links higher intakes of vitamin E with decreased incidence of breast cancer, an examination of the impact of dietary factors, including vitamin E, on the incidence of postmenopausal breast cancer in >18,000 women found no benefit from the vitamin . The American Cancer Society conducted an epidemiologic study examining the association between use of vitamin C and vitamin E supplements and bladder cancer mortality. Of the almost one million adults followed between 1982 and 1998, adults who took supplemental vitamin E for 10 years or longer had a reduced risk of death from bladder cancer ; vitamin C supplementation provided no protection. Evidence to date is insufficient to support taking vitamin E to prevent cancer. In fact, daily use of large-dose vitamin E supplements (400 IU of synthetic vitamin E [180 mg]) may increase the risk of prostate cancer. Eye disorders Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts are among the most common causes of significant vision loss in older people. Their etiologies are usually unknown, but the cumulative effects of oxidative stress have been postulated to play a role. If so, nutrients with antioxidant functions, such as vitamin E, could be used to prevent or treat these conditions. Prospective cohort studies have found that people with relatively high dietary intakes of vitamin E (e.g., 20 mg/day [30 IU]) have an approximately 20% lower risk of developing AMD than people with low intakes (e.g., <10 mg/day [<15 IU]) . However, two randomized controlled trials in which participants took supplements of vitamin E (500 IU/day [335 mg] d-alpha-tocopherol in one study and 111 IU/day (50 mg) dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate combined with 20 mg/day beta-carotene in the other ) or a placebo failed to show a protective effect for vitamin E on AMD. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a large randomized clinical trial, found that participants at high risk of developing advanced AMD (i.e., those with intermediate AMD or those with advanced AMD in one eye) reduced their risk of developing advanced AMD by 25% by taking a daily supplement containing vitamin E (400 IU [180 mg] dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate), beta-carotene (15 mg), vitamin C (500 mg), zinc (80 mg), and copper (2 mg) compared to participants taking a placebo over 5 years . A follow-up AREDS2 study confirmed the value of this and similar supplement formulations in reducing the progression of AMD over a median follow-up period of 5 years . Several observational studies have revealed a potential relationship between vitamin E supplements and the risk of cataract formation. One prospective cohort study found that lens clarity was superior in participants who took vitamin E supplements and those with higher blood levels of the vitamin . In another study, long-term use of vitamin E supplements was associated with slower progression of age-related lens opacification . However, in the AREDS trial, the use of a vitamin E-containing (as dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate) formulation had no apparent effect on the development or progression of cataracts over an average of 6.3 years . The AREDS2 study, which also tested formulations containing 400 IU (180 mg) vitamin E, confirmed these findings . Overall, the available evidence is inconsistent with respect to whether vitamin E supplements, taken alone or in combination with other antioxidants, can reduce the risk of developing AMD or cataracts. However, the formulations of vitamin E, other antioxidants, zinc, and copper used in AREDS hold promise for slowing the progression of AMD in people at high risk of developing advanced AMD. Cognitive decline The brain has a high oxygen consumption rate and abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids in the neuronal cell membranes. Researchers hypothesize that if cumulative free-radical damage to neurons over time contributes to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, then ingestion of sufficient or supplemental antioxidants (such as vitamin E) might provide some protection . This hypothesis was supported by the results of a clinical trial in 341 patients with Alzheimer’s disease of moderate severity who were randomly assigned to receive a placebo, vitamin E (2,000 IU/day dl-alpha-tocopherol), a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (selegiline), or vitamin E and selegiline . Over 2 years, treatment with vitamin E and selegiline, separately or together, significantly delayed functional deterioration and the need for institutionalization compared to placebo. However, participants taking vitamin E experienced significantly more falls. Vitamin E consumption from foods or supplements was associated with less cognitive decline over 3 years in a prospective cohort study of elderly, free-living individuals age 65–102 years . However, a clinical trial in primarily healthy older women who were randomly assigned to receive 600 IU (402 mg) d-alpha-tocopherol every other day or a placebo for ≤4 years found that the supplements provided no apparent cognitive benefits . Another trial in which 769 men and women with mild cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to receive 2,000 IU/day vitamin E (form not specified), a cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil), or placebo found no significant differences in the progression rate of Alzheimer’s disease between the vitamin E and placebo groups In summary, most research results do not support the use of vitamin E supplements by healthy or mildly impaired individuals to maintain cognitive performance or slow its decline with normal aging . More research is needed to identify the role of vitamin E, if any, in the management of cognitive impairment . Health Risks from Excessive Vitamin E Research has not found any adverse effects from consuming vitamin E in food . However, high doses of alpha-tocopherol supplements can cause hemorrhage and interrupt blood coagulation in animals, and in vitro data suggest that high doses inhibit platelet aggregation. Two clinical trials have found an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in participants taking alpha-tocopherol; one trial included Finnish male smokers who consumed 50 mg/day for an average of 6 years and the other trial involved a large group of male physicians in the United States who consumed 400 IU (180 mg) of synthetic vitamin E every other day for 8 years . Because the majority of physicians in the latter study were also taking aspirin, this finding could indicate that vitamin E has a tendency to cause bleeding. The FNB has established ULs for vitamin E based on the potential for hemorrhagic effects (see Table 3). The ULs apply to all forms of supplemental alpha-tocopherol, including the eight stereoisomers present in synthetic vitamin E. Doses of up to 1,000 mg/day (1,500 IU/day of the natural form or 1,100 IU/day of the synthetic form) in adults appear to be safe, although the data are limited and based on small groups of people taking up to 3,200 mg/day of alpha-tocopherol for only a few weeks or months. Long-term intakes above the UL increase the risk of adverse health effects . Vitamin E ULs for infants have not been established. Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Vitamin E 1–3 years: Male: 200 mg, Female: 200 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 300 mg, Female: 300 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation: ,  9–13 years: Male: 600 mg, Female: 600 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 800 mg, Female: 800 mg, Pregnancy: 800 mg, Lactation: 800 mg 19+ years: Male: 1,000 mg, Female: 1,000 mg, Pregnancy: 1,000 mg, Lactation: 1,000 mg Two meta-analyses of randomized trials have also raised questions about the safety of large doses of vitamin E, including doses lower than the UL. These meta-analyses linked supplementation to small but statistically significant increases in all-cause mortality. One analysis found an increased risk of death at doses of 400 IU/day (form not specified), although the risk began to increase at 150 IU . In the other analysis of studies of antioxidant supplements for disease prevention, the highest quality trials revealed that vitamin E, administered singly (dose range 10 IU–5,000 IU/day; mean 569 IU [form not specified]) or combined with up to four other antioxidants, significantly increased mortality risk . The implications of these analyses for the potential adverse effects of high-dose vitamin E supplements are unclear [56-59]. Participants in the studies included in these analyses were typically middle-aged or older and had chronic diseases or related risk factors. These participants often consumed other supplements in addition to vitamin E. Some of the studies analyzed took place in developing countries in which nutritional deficiencies are common. A review of the subset of studies in which vitamin E supplements were given to healthy individuals for the primary prevention of chronic disease found no convincing evidence that the supplements increased mortality . However, results from the recently published, large SELECT trial show that vitamin E supplements (400 IU/day [180 mg] as dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate) may harm adult men in the general population by increasing their risk of prostate cancer . Follow-up studies are assessing whether the cancer risk was associated with baseline blood levels of vitamin E and selenium prior to supplementation as well as whether changes in one or more genes might increase a man’s risk of developing prostate cancer while taking vitamin E. Interactions with Medications Vitamin E supplements have the potential to interact with several types of medications. A few examples are provided below. People taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their vitamin E intakes with their health care providers. Anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications Vitamin E can inhibit platelet aggregation and antagonize vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. As a result, taking large doses with anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, such as warfarin (Coumadin), can increase the risk of bleeding, especially in conjunction with low vitamin K intake. The amounts of supplemental vitamin E needed to produce clinically significant effects are unknown but probably exceed 400 IU/day . Simvastatin and niacin Some people take vitamin E supplements with other antioxidants, such as vitamin C, selenium, and beta-carotene. This collection of antioxidant ingredients blunted the rise in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, especially levels of HDL2, the most cardioprotective HDL component, among people treated with a combination of simvastatin (brand name Zocor) and niacin . Chemotherapy and radiotherapy Oncologists generally advise against the use of antioxidant supplements during cancer chemotherapy or radiotherapy because they might reduce the effectiveness of these therapies by inhibiting cellular oxidative damage in cancerous cells . Although a systematic review of randomized controlled trials has called this concern into question , further research is needed to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of concurrent antioxidant supplementation with conventional therapies for cancer. Vitamin E and Healthful Diets The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that “Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. … In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).” For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA’s MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that • Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. ​​​​​​​Vitamin E is found in green leafy vegetables, whole grains, fortified cereals, and vegetable oils. • ​​​​​​​Vitamin E is found in green leafy vegetables, whole grains, fortified cereals, and vegetable oils. • Includes a variety of protein foods such as lean meats; poultry; eggs; seafood; beans, peas, and lentils; nuts and seeds; and soy products. ​​​​​​​Nuts are good sources of vitamin E. • ​​​​​​​Nuts are good sources of vitamin E. • Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. • Limits alcoholic beverages. • Stays within your daily calorie needs. • ​​​​​​​Vitamin E is found in green leafy vegetables, whole grains, fortified cereals, and vegetable oils. • ​​​​​​​Nuts are good sources of vitamin E."

      "content": "Introduction Calcium, the most abundant mineral in the body, is found in some foods, added to others, present in some medicines (such as antacids), and available as a dietary supplement. Calcium makes up much of the structure of bones and teeth and allows normal bodily movement by keeping tissue rigid, strong, and flexible . The small ionized pool of calcium in the circulatory system, extracellular fluid, and various tissues mediates blood vessel contraction and dilation, muscle function, blood clotting, nerve transmission, and hormonal secretion . Calcium from foods and dietary supplements is absorbed by both active transport and by passive diffusion across the intestinal mucosa . Active transport is responsible for most absorption when calcium intakes are lower, and passive diffusion accounts for an increasing proportion of calcium absorption as intakes rise. Vitamin D is required for calcium to be absorbed in the gut by active transport and to maintain adequate calcium levels in blood . Almost all (98%) calcium in the body is stored in the bones, and the body uses the bones as a reservoir for, and source of, calcium to maintain calcium homeostasis . More than 99% of calcium in the body is in the form of calcium hydroxyapatite, an inorganic matrix of calcium and phosphate that is stored in the bones and teeth . Unlike teeth, bone undergoes continuous remodeling, with constant resorption and deposition of calcium into new bone . Bone remodeling is required to change bone size during growth, repair damage, maintain serum calcium levels, and provide a source of other minerals . At birth, the body contains about 26 to 30 g calcium. This amount rises quickly after birth, reaching about 1,200 g in women and 1,400 g in men by adulthood . These levels remain constant in men, but they start to drop in women as a result of increases in bone remodeling due to decreased estrogen production at the start of menopause . An inverse relationship exists between calcium intake and absorption. Absorption of calcium from food is about 45% at intakes of 200 mg/day but only 15% when intakes are higher than 2,000 mg/day . Age can also affect absorption of dietary calcium . Net absorption of dietary calcium is as high as 60% in infants and young children, who need substantial amounts to build bone, but it decreases to about 25% in adulthood and continues to decline with age . Total calcium levels can be measured in serum or plasma; serum levels are typically 8.8 to 10.4 mg/dL (2.2 to 2.6 mmol/L) in healthy people . However, serum levels do not reflect nutritional status because of their tight homeostatic control . Levels of ionized (or free) calcium, the biologically active form, in serum are also used to measure calcium status. The normal range of ionized calcium in healthy people is 4.6 to 5.3 mg/dL (1.15 to 1.33 mmol/L) . Dual x-ray absorptiometry testing of bone mineral density can be used to assess cumulative calcium status over the lifetime because the skeleton stores almost all calcium in the body . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for calcium and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used for planning and assessing nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: • Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals • Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA • Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals • Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Table 1 lists the current RDAs for calcium . For adults, the main criterion that the FNB used to establish the RDAs was the amount needed to promote bone maintenance and neutral calcium balance. For infants age 0 to 12 months, the FNB established an AI that is equivalent to the mean intake of calcium in healthy, breastfed infants. For children and adolescents, the RDAs are based on intakes associated with bone accumulation and positive calcium balance. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Calcium 0–6 months*: Male: 200 mg, Female: 200 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  7–12 months*: Male: 260 mg, Female: 260 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  1–3 years: Male: 700 mg, Female: 700 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  4–8 years: Male: 1,000 mg, Female: 1,000 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  9–13 years: Male: 1,300 mg, Female: 1,300 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  14–18 years: Male: 1,300 mg, Female: 1,300 mg, Pregnant: 1,300 mg, Lactating: 1,300 mg 19–50 years: Male: 1,000 mg, Female: 1,000 mg, Pregnant: 1,000 mg, Lactating: 1,000 mg 51–70 years: Male: 1,000 mg, Female: 1,200 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  >70+ years: Male: 1,200 mg, Female: 1,200 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  *Adequate Intake (AI) Sources of Calcium Food Milk, yogurt, and cheese are rich natural sources of calcium . In the United States, approximately 72% of calcium intakes come from dairy products and foods with added dairy ingredients . Nondairy sources include canned sardines and salmon with bones as well as certain vegetables, such as kale, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage (bok choi). Most grains do not have high amounts of calcium unless they are fortified. However, they contribute to calcium intakes, even though they contain small amounts of calcium, because people consume them frequently . Foods fortified with calcium in the United States include many fruit juices and drinks, tofu, and ready-to-eat cereals . Calcium citrate malate is a well-absorbed form of calcium used in some fortified juices . Calcium absorption varies by type of food. The absorption of calcium from dairy products and fortified foods is about 30% . Certain compounds in plants (e.g., oxalic acid, phytic acid) can decrease calcium absorption by forming indigestible salts with calcium, decreasing its absorption . As a result, absorption of calcium is only 5% for spinach, whereas it is much higher, at 27%, for milk . In addition to spinach, foods with high levels of oxalic acid include collard greens, sweet potatoes, rhubarb, and beans . The bioavailability of calcium from other plants that do not contain these compounds—including broccoli, kale, and cabbage—is similar to that of milk, although the amount of calcium per serving is much lower . When people eat many different types of foods, these interactions with oxalic or phytic acid probably have little or no nutritional consequences. Net absorption of dietary calcium is also reduced to a small extent by intakes of caffeine and phosphorus and to a greater extent by low status of vitamin D [9-11]. A variety of foods and their calcium content are listed in Table 2.

Dietary supplements Calcium is available in many dietary supplements, including multivitamin/mineral products and supplements containing calcium only or calcium plus vitamin D . Amounts of calcium in supplements vary widely; multivitamin/mineral supplements commonly contain about 200 to 300 mg, and common amounts in calcium or calcium plus vitamin D supplements are 500 or 600 mg . The two most common forms of calcium in supplements are calcium carbonate and calcium citrate . In people with low levels of stomach acid, the solubility rate of calcium carbonate is lower, which could reduce the absorption of calcium from calcium carbonate supplements unless they are taken with a meal . Calcium citrate is less dependent on stomach acid for absorption than calcium carbonate, so it can be taken without food . In general, however, absorption of calcium supplements is greater when they are taken with food, regardless of whether the user’s gastric acid is low . Other calcium forms in supplements include calcium sulfate, ascorbate, microcrystalline hydroxyapatite, gluconate, lactate, and phosphate . The forms of calcium in supplements contain varying amounts of elemental calcium. For example, calcium carbonate is 40% calcium by weight, whereas calcium citrate is 21% calcium . Elemental calcium is listed in the Supplement Facts panel, so consumers do not need to calculate the amount of calcium supplied by various forms of calcium in supplements. The percentage of calcium absorbed from supplements, as with that from foods, depends not only on the source of calcium but also on the total amount of elemental calcium consumed at one time; as the amount increases, the percentage absorbed decreases. Absorption from supplements is highest with doses of 500 mg or less . For example, the body absorbs about 36% of a 300 mg calcium dose and 28% of a 1,000 mg dose . Some individuals who take calcium supplements might experience gastrointestinal side effects, including gas, bloating, constipation, or a combination of these symptoms. Calcium carbonate appears to cause more of these side effects than calcium citrate, especially in older adults who have lower levels of stomach acid . Symptoms can be alleviated by switching to a supplement containing a different form of calcium, taking smaller calcium doses more often during the day, or taking the supplement with meals. Medicines Because of its ability to neutralize stomach acid, calcium carbonate is contained in some over-the-counter antacid products, such as Tums and Rolaids. Depending on its strength, each chewable pill or soft chew provides about 270 to 400 mg of calcium . Calcium Intakes and Status A substantial proportion of people in the United States consume less than recommended amounts of calcium. An analysis of 2007–2010 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that 49% of children age 4–18 years and 39% of all individuals age 4 and older consume less than the EAR for calcium from foods and supplements . Average daily intakes of calcium from foods and beverages are 1,083 mg for men age 20 and older and 842 mg for women . For children age 2–19, mean daily intakes of calcium from foods and beverages range from 965 to 1,015 mg . Approximately 22% of men, 32% of women, and 4% to 8% of children take a dietary supplement containing calcium . Average daily calcium intakes from both foods and supplements are 1,156 mg for men, 1,009 mg for women, and 968 to 1,020 mg for children . According to 2009–2012 NHANES data, rates of calcium inadequacy (intakes below the EAR) are higher among non-Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic Asians (47%–48%) than among Hispanics (30%) and non-Hispanic Whites (24%) in the United States . Poverty is also associated with a higher risk of inadequacy. NHANES data from 2007 to 2014 show that the risk of inadequate calcium intakes (less than 800 to 1,100 mg) is 11.6% higher among adults age 50 and older in households earning less than $20,000 per year than other households . Calcium Deficiency Calcium deficiency can reduce bone strength and lead to osteoporosis, which is characterized by fragile bones and an increased risk of falling . Calcium deficiency can also cause rickets in children and other bone disorders in adults, although these disorders are more commonly caused by vitamin D deficiency. In children with rickets, the growth cartilage does not mineralize normally, which can lead to irreversible changes in the skeletal structure . Another effect of chronic calcium deficiency is osteomalacia, or defective bone mineralization and bone softening, which can occur in adults and children . For rickets and osteomalacia, the requirements for calcium and vitamin D appear to be interrelated in that the lower the serum vitamin D level (measured as 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]), the more calcium is needed to prevent these diseases . Hypocalcemia (serum calcium level less than 8.5 mg/dL [2.12 mmol/L] or an ionized calcium level below 4.61 mg/dL [1.15 mmol/L]) is usually a result of a vitamin D or magnesium deficiency, impaired parathyroid hormone production leading to hypoparathyroidism, impaired bone resorption of calcium, critical illness, or use of certain medications (e.g., bisphosphonates, cisplatin, or proton pump inhibitors) . Hypocalcemia can be asymptomatic, especially when it is mild or chronic . When signs and symptoms do occur, they can range widely because low serum calcium levels can affect most organs and symptoms . The most common symptom is increased neuromuscular irritability, including perioral numbness, tingling in the hands and feet, and muscle spasms . More severe signs and symptoms can include renal calcification or injury; brain calcification; neurologic symptoms (e.g., depression and bipolar disorder); cataracts; congestive heart failure; paresthesia; seizures; and, in rare cases, coma . Groups at Risk of Calcium Inadequacy The following groups are among those most likely to need extra calcium. Postmenopausal women Menopause leads to bone loss because decreases in estrogen production reduce calcium absorption and increase urinary calcium loss and calcium resorption from bone . On average, women lose approximately 1% of their bone mineral density (BMD) per year after menopause . Over time, these changes lead to decreased bone mass and fragile bones . About 30% of postmenopausal women in the United States and Europe have osteoporosis, and at least 40% of those with this condition develop at least one fragility fracture (a fracture that occurs after minor trauma, such as a fall from standing height or lower) . The calcium RDA is 1,200 mg for women older than 50 years (vs. 1,000 mg for younger women) to lessen bone loss after menopause . Individuals who avoid dairy products People with lactose intolerance, those with an allergy to milk, and those who avoid eating dairy products (including vegans) have a higher risk of inadequate calcium intakes because dairy products are rich sources of calcium . Options for increasing calcium intakes in individuals with lactose intolerance include consuming lactose-free or reduced-lactose dairy products, which contain the same amounts of calcium as regular dairy products . Those who avoid dairy products because of allergies or for other reasons can obtain calcium from nondairy sources, such as some vegetables (e.g., kale, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage [bok choi]), canned fish with bones, or fortified foods (e.g., fruit juices, breakfast cereals, and tofu) . However, these individuals typically need to eat foods fortified with calcium or take supplements to obtain recommended amounts . Calcium and Health This section focuses on six health conditions and diseases in which calcium might play a role: bone health in older adults, cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD), preeclampsia, weight management, and metabolic syndrome. Bone health in older adults Bone is constantly being remodeled. Declining levels of estrogen in women during menopause and for approximately 5 years afterward lead to rates of bone resorption that are higher than rates of bone formation, resulting in a rapid decrease in bone mass . Over time, postmenopausal women can develop osteoporosis, in which bone strength is compromised because of lower BMD and bone quality . Age-related bone loss can also occur in men and lead to osteoporosis, but fracture risk tends to increase in older men about 5 to 10 years later than in older women . Osteoporosis increases the risk of fractures, especially of the hip, vertebrae, and forearms . FDA has approved a health claim for the use of supplements containing calcium and vitamin D to reduce the risk of osteoporosis . However, not all research supports this claim. In spite of the importance of calcium in bone health, observational evidence is mixed on the link between calcium intakes and measures of bone strength in older adults. Support for such a link comes from an analysis of 2001–2006 NHANES cross-sectional data on 2,904 adults age 60 and older (54.6% women) showing an association between higher dietary calcium intakes and greater lumbar spine BMD, but only in women . In contrast, an analysis of baseline data from a randomized trial in Australia in 1,994 women older than 65 years whose average dietary calcium intake was 886 mg/day found no association between quintile of calcium intake and BMD at any site, even after adjustment for such factors as age, physical activity, height, and weight . Results were similar in 698 of the women who were followed for 6 years, even though mean daily intakes of calcium dropped by an average of 40 mg during this period. Some but not all clinical trials have found that calcium supplementation can improve bone health in older adults. A post-hoc analysis of data from a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 1,000 mg elemental calcium in the form of calcium carbonate and 400 International Units (IU) (10 microgram [mcg]) vitamin D3 daily or placebo in 36,282 women age 50–79 years enrolled in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) found that the supplementation did not prevent height loss after a mean follow-up period of 5.9 years . On average, women lost 1.28 mm/year of height in the supplementation group and 1.26 mm/year in the placebo group. However, a 2-year RCT in 500 healthy postmenopausal women showed that daily intakes of 500 ml/day skimmed milk enriched to provide 900 mg calcium and 15 mcg (600 IU) vitamin D led to increased BMD at the femoral neck . Several recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found that supplementation with calcium alone or a combination of calcium and vitamin D increases BMD in older adults. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis included 15 RCTs in postmenopausal women (but did not include the two studies described in the previous paragraph) in 78,206 women, of which 37,412 were in the intervention group and 40,794 were in the control group . Supplementation with both calcium and vitamin D or consumption of dairy products fortified with both nutrients increased total BMD as well as BMD at the lumbar spine, arms, and femoral neck. However, in subgroup analyses, calcium had no effect on femoral neck BMD. Earlier systematic reviews and meta-analyses found a positive relationship between calcium and vitamin D supplementation and increased BMD in older males and between higher calcium intakes from dietary sources or supplements and higher BMD in adults older than 50 . However, whether these BMD increases were clinically significant is not clear. As with the evidence on the link between increased calcium intakes and reductions in BMD loss, the findings of research on the use of calcium supplementation to prevent fractures in older adults are mixed. For the most part, the observational evidence does not show that increasing calcium intakes reduces the risk of fractures and falls in older adults. For example, a longitudinal cohort study of 1,490 women age 42 to 52 years at baseline who were followed for 10–12 years found that fracture risk was not significantly different in calcium supplement users (some of whom also took vitamin D supplements) and nonusers, even though supplement use was associated with less BMD loss throughout the study period . Some clinical trial evidence shows that supplements containing a combination of calcium and vitamin D can reduce the risk of fractures in older adults. For example, a meta-analysis of 8 RCTs in 30,970 adults older than 50 years found that 500 to 1,200 mg/day calcium and 400 to 800 IU/day (10 to 20 mcg/day) vitamin D supplementation for 1 to 7 years reduced the risk of total fractures by 15% and hip fractures by 30% . However, findings were negative in another systematic review and meta-analysis that included 14 RCTs of calcium supplementation and 13 trials comparing calcium and vitamin D supplements with hormone therapy, placebo, or no treatment in participants older than 50 years . The results showed that calcium supplementation alone had no effect on risk of hip fracture, and supplementation with both calcium and vitamin D had no effect on risk of hip fracture, nonvertebral fracture, vertebral fracture, or total fracture. Similarly, a systematic review of 11 RCTs in 51,419 adults age 50 and older found that supplementation with vitamin D and calcium for 2 to 7 years had no impact on risk of total fractures or of hip fractures . The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded with moderate certainty that daily doses of less than 1,000 mg calcium and less than 400 IU (10 mcg) vitamin D do not prevent fractures in postmenopausal women and that the evidence on larger doses of this combination is inadequate to assess the benefits in this population . The USPSTF also determined the evidence on the benefits of calcium supplementation alone or with vitamin D to be inadequate to assess its effect on preventing fractures in men and premenopausal women. Additional research is needed before conclusions can be drawn about the use of calcium supplements to improve bone health and prevent fractures in older adults. Cancer Calcium might help reduce the risk of cancer, especially in the colon and rectum . However, evidence on the relationship between calcium intakes from foods or supplements and different forms of cancer is inconsistent . Most clinical trial evidence does not support a beneficial effect of calcium supplements on cancer incidence. A 4-year study of 1,500 mg calcium and 2,000 IU (50 mcg) vitamin D or placebo daily for 4 years in 2,303 healthy women age 55 years and older showed that supplementation did not reduce the risk of all types of cancer . The large WHI study described above also found no effect of supplemental calcium and vitamin D on cancer incidence during the 7-year trial and over a long-term median follow-up of 22.3 years . In addition, a meta-analysis of 10 RCTs that included 10,496 individuals who took supplements containing 500 mg calcium or more (without vitamin D) for a mean of 3.9 years found that calcium supplementation did not change the total cancer risk . However, one large clinical trial did find that calcium supplements reduce cancer risk. In this 4-year trial, by the same investigators as the 4-year trial above, 1,179 women age 55 years or older in Nebraska took 1,400 to 1,500 mg calcium alone; 1,400 to 1,500 mg calcium plus 1,100 IU (27.5 mcg) vitamin D3; or placebo daily. Cancer incidence from all causes was 60% lower in women who took the combination and 47% lower in those who took calcium-only supplements than in the placebo group . Some scientists have questioned these findings because of the lack of statistical power (the studies were designed to detect differences in bone health measures, not cancer incidence), details from the investigators on the study sample, and randomization procedures . Observational evidence does not support an association between higher calcium intakes and a lower risk of cancer mortality. An analysis of data on 132,823 participants in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, who were followed for an average of 17.5 years, found no association between total dietary and supplemental calcium intakes and risk of cancer-related death or death from lung, colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer in men or women . A systematic review and meta-analysis of 22 observational studies in 2,346,368 participants age 8 and older followed for 4.6 to 28 years also found no association between total dietary and supplemental calcium intake and cancer mortality . Results from many, but not all, clinical trials also suggest that supplemental calcium alone or combined with vitamin D does not affect risk of mortality from all cancers. An RCT in 5,292 adults age 70 years or older (85% women) in the United Kingdom compared the effects of 1,000 mg calcium, 8,000 IU (200 mcg) vitamin D3, both, or placebo for 24 to 62 months . Rates of cancer incidence and cancer mortality did not differ between those who did and those who did not receive calcium supplements. In the WHI trial, 36,282 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to daily supplementation with a combination of 1,000 mg calcium and 400 IU (10 mcg) vitamin D3 or placebo . After an average of 7 years, risk of cancer mortality did not differ between groups. However, over a long-term median follow-up of 22.3 years, cancer mortality was 7% lower among women who received calcium and vitamin D supplements compared with those who received placebo . The meta-analysis described above of 10 RCTs that administered calcium alone and that included 10,496 individuals found no impact of calcium supplementation on cancer mortality rates . A substantial body of evidence has addressed the role of calcium in preventing colorectal cancer or its precursor, adenomas. Much but not all of the observational evidence supports a link between higher calcium intakes and lower risk of colorectal cancer. A cohort study in 77,712 adults found that over a mean of 7.8 years, the highest total intake of dietary and supplemental calcium (median of 1,999 mg/day) was associated with a 26% lower risk of colon cancer than the lowest quintile (587 mg/day) but had no association with risk of rectal cancer . In a dose-response meta-analysis of 15 prospective cohort studies in 1,415,597 participants (mean total dietary and supplemental calcium intake 250 to 1,900 mg/day) followed for 3.3 to 16 years, risk of colorectal cancer dropped by 8% with each 300 mg/day increase in total calcium intake . Findings were similar for dietary intakes of calcium in two other meta-analyses . In spite of the observational evidence supporting an association between higher calcium intakes and lower colorectal cancer risk, clinical trials investigating calcium supplements for prevention of colorectal cancer or adenomas have had mixed results. A 2013 follow-up study by Cauley and colleagues evaluated outcomes 4.9 years after completion of the 7-year WHI trial of 1,000 mg/day calcium plus 400 IU (10 mcg)/day vitamin D3 or placebo in 36,282 postmenopausal women . Colorectal cancer rates did not differ between groups. Similarly, in a follow-up study an average of 55 months after administration of 1,200 mg/day calcium, 1,000 IU (25 mcg)/day vitamin D3, or both for 3 to 5 years in 1,121 participants, supplements had no effect on risk of recurrent adenomas . However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of four RCTs (not including the 2013 study by Cauley and colleagues) found that daily supplementation with 1,200 to 2,000 mg elemental calcium for 36 to 60 months reduced the likelihood of recurrent adenomas by 11%, although the supplements had no effect on risk of advanced adenomas . Several observational studies have shown that the risk of prostate cancer might be higher with higher calcium intakes, but possibly only when the calcium comes from dairy foods. In an analysis of data from 2,776 men who participated in the French SU.VI.MAX (Supplementation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants) prospective study and were followed for an average of 7.7 years, prostate cancer risk was higher with higher calcium intakes . The risk was 2.4 times higher in men in the highest quartile of intake (more than 1,081 mg/day) than those with the lowest quartile (less than 725 mg/day). However, in analyses of results for various sources of calcium, only calcium from dairy foods was significantly associated with prostate cancer risk (2.9 times higher in men with intakes greater than 696 mg/day than in those with intakes less than 354 mg/day); calcium intakes from nondairy sources were not significantly associated with prostate cancer risk. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of nine cohort studies in 750,275 men, the risk of prostate cancer was 2% higher for each 400 mg/day increment in total dietary and supplemental calcium intake, but nondairy and supplemental calcium intakes were not associated with prostate cancer risk . A meta-analysis included 15 epidemiological studies of calcium intake and ovarian cancer risk in 493,415 women who developed 7,453 cases of ovarian cancer . In this meta-analysis, ovarian cancer risk was 20% lower in participants in the highest category of dietary calcium intakes (more than 820–1,500 mg/day, depending on the study) than the lowest intake category (less than 362–800 mg/day, depending on the study). However, the difference in risk was not statistically significant when both dietary and supplemental calcium intakes were considered. For breast cancer, observational studies have had mixed findings on whether higher calcium intakes are associated with a lower risk. A meta-analysis of 11 prospective cohort studies in 872,895 women who developed 26,606 cases of breast cancer over 7 to 25 years found that women with the highest calcium intakes had an 8% lower risk of breast cancer . However, the WHI (described above) found similar incidence rates of invasive breast cancer in the supplement and placebo groups . Additional well-designed randomized trials are needed to determine whether dietary or supplemental calcium intakes increase, decrease, or have no effect on risk of cancer in general or of specific types of cancer, or on cancer mortality. Cardiovascular disease Calcium binds fatty acids, so it can reduce lipid absorption and might therefore lower CVD risk . However, the findings from research on the role of dietary calcium and calcium supplements in reducing CVD have been mixed, and some evidence indicates that calcium supplements might even increase CVD risk. Several large observational studies have shown an association between lower calcium intakes and higher risk of hypertension, stroke, and atherosclerosis. For example, an analysis of 1999–2010 NHANES data from 14,408 adults (mean age 54 years) with obesity found that calcium intakes were 10% lower in adults with obesity and hypertension than in those without hypertension . This association was strongest in women, adults age 20–44 years, those who did not have diabetes, and especially women age 20–44 years. A prospective cohort study that followed 41,514 adults age 40 to 69 years in Australia for 13 years found a 25% lower rate of stroke in adults in the highest calcium intake quartile (mean of 1,076 mg/day) than in the lowest quartile (mean of 641 mg/day) . However, the study found no association between calcium intakes and risk of CVD mortality or myocardial infarction. The risk of atherosclerosis over 10 years in a study of 5,448 adults age 45–84 years was 27% lower in the highest quintile of calcium intake (mean of 2,157 mg/day) than in the lowest quintile (mean of 313 mg/day) . Furthermore, a systematic review and meta-analysis that included 27 observational studies found no consistent dose-response relationships between total, dietary, or supplemental calcium intakes and CVD mortality . Evidence on dose-response relationships between calcium intakes and risk of stroke or stroke mortality was inconsistent. A diet containing more calcium than the typical U.S. diet because of added low-fat or nonfat dairy products lowered systolic blood pressure by an average of 5.5 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 3.0 mmHg . However, this Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet also increases intakes of other nutrients, such as potassium and magnesium, that are associated with reductions in blood pressure, so any independent contribution of calcium cannot be determined. Some clinical trials have shown that calcium supplements are associated with decreased hypertension risk or decreased cholesterol levels, but others have had more mixed findings. A Cochrane Review of 16 trials in 3,048 adults with a median follow-up period of 3.5 months found that calcium supplementation (typically 1,000 to 2,000 mg/day) reduced systolic blood pressure by 1.43 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 0.98 mmHg . Effects were greatest in adults younger than 35 years and with doses higher than 1,500 mg/day calcium. A meta-analysis of 23 RCTs in 4,071 participants showed that calcium supplements providing 162 to 2,000 mg/day (combined with vitamin D in 10 RCTs) for 2 weeks to 5 years was associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels that were 4.6 mg/dL lower and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels that were 1.9 mg/dL higher . Findings were mixed in two analyses of data from the WHI. One analysis of results from 35,983 women age 50 to 79 years randomly assigned to 1,000 mg/day calcium and 400 IU (10 mcg)/day vitamin D supplements or placebo for 10 years found no reduction in risk of heart failure . However, the calcium and vitamin D supplements were associated with 5% lower heart failure risk in participants who had no pre-existing heart failure risk factors (coronary heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension). In another secondary analysis of data on 16,801 WHI participants, the supplements had no association with atrial fibrillation risk . An analysis of long-term health outcomes from the WHI over a median follow-up of 22.3 years found no effect of calcium and vitamin D supplements on cardiovascular disease risk . Similarly, an evidence report and systematic review conducted for the USPSTF that included 11 RCTs of vitamin D, calcium, or both for 2 to 7 years in 51,419 adults age 50 years and older found that supplementation with vitamin D alone or combined with calcium had no effect on CVD incidence . In contrast, several prospective cohort studies and RCTs have shown that calcium supplements increase the risk of CVD. A meta-analysis of 14 RCTs (including one study that administered supplements providing 20 mcg [800 IU] vitamin D per day) in 28,935 healthy postmenopausal women found that calcium supplements providing 500 to 2,000 mg/day calcium for 1 to 7 years increased CVD risk by 15% and coronary heart disease risk by 16% . In addition, when 132,823 adults (mean age 63 years) were followed for an average of 17.5 years, the risk of CVD mortality was 22% higher in men with calcium supplement intakes of 1,000 mg/day or more than in those not taking calcium supplements . However, in women, the CVD mortality rate was 16% lower with supplemental calcium intakes of 1,000 mg/day than with no supplemental calcium intakes. An analysis of long-term health outcomes from the WHI over a median follow-up of 22.3 years found that women who received calcium and vitamin D supplements had a 6% higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease than those who received placebo . Other studies have found no association between calcium supplements and CVD risk or CVD outcomes. After 24 years of follow-up of 74,245 women age 30 to 55 years at baseline who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study, women taking more than 1,000 mg/day calcium supplements did not have a higher risk of CVD than those taking no supplemental calcium . An expert panel convened by the National Osteoporosis Foundation and American Society for Preventive Cardiology determined, on the basis of moderate-quality evidence, that calcium intakes with or without vitamin D from foods or supplements neither increase nor decrease the risk of CVD or CVD mortality . The societies therefore concluded that calcium intakes that do not exceed the UL are safe “from a cardiovascular standpoint.” Preeclampsia Preeclampsia is defined as hypertension and proteinuria or thrombocytopenia during pregnancy, usually after 20 weeks’ gestation . It is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality that affects about 4% of pregnancies in the United States . Calcium supplementation during pregnancy might reduce the risk of preeclampsia, but the benefits might apply only to women with inadequate calcium intakes, and much of this evidence comes from studies with methodological weaknesses . A Cochrane Review included 27 RCTs of calcium supplements during pregnancy in 18,064 women to prevent hypertensive disorders and related problems . In the 13 studies—none of which administered vitamin D supplements—that evaluated high doses (at least 1,000 mg/day calcium) in 15,730 women, supplementation reduced the risk of high blood pressure by 35% and, in women with low dietary calcium intakes (less than 900 mg/day; 8 trials in 10,678 women), the risk of preeclampsia by 64%. However, the quality of this evidence was low. In 12 trials in 2,334 women, doses of less than 1,000 mg/day (usually 500 mg/day) reduced the risk of high blood pressure by 47% and of preeclampsia by 62%. However, most of these studies recruited women at high risk of preeclampsia and had a high risk of bias. An earlier systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 RCTs in 24,787 women also found that calcium supplementation (1,500 to 2,000 mg/day) reduced the risk of preeclampsia by 38% and, in women at increased risk of any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, by 64% . However, when the analysis was restricted to trials with 4,000 or more women, the effect was no longer statistically significant. An RCT in 1,355 women in Argentina, South Africa, and Zimbabwe also found that 500 mg/day calcium supplementation starting before conception made no difference in the risk of preeclampsia . Several professional organizations recommend calcium supplements during pregnancy for women with low calcium intakes to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. For example, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology states that daily supplementation with 1,500–2,000 mg calcium might reduce the severity of preeclampsia in pregnant women who have calcium intakes of less than 600 mg/day . The World Health Organization recommends 1,500–2,000 mg/day calcium for pregnant women with low dietary calcium intakes to reduce preeclampsia risk . The Canadian Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy Working Group , the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy , and the Society of Obstetric Medicine of Australia and New Zealand have similar recommendations. Weight management Observational and clinical trial evidence linking higher calcium intakes from dairy products or supplements to lower body weight or less weight gain over time is mixed. An observational study found an association between higher calcium intakes and lower prevalence of overweight or obesity in 6,696 children (51% male, mean age 6 years) in eight European countries, of whom 2,744 were re-examined 6 years later . The prevalence of overweight or obesity at 6-year follow-up was lower in boys (16%) and girls (18%) in the highest tertile of calcium intake (664 mg/1,000 kcal for boys and 667 mg/1,000 kcal for girls) than in boys (26%) and girls (25%) in the lowest tertile (249 mg/1,000 kcal for both boys and girls). In contrast, a longitudinal study in 2,159 participants in Portugal evaluated at ages 13 and 21 years found no association between total dietary and supplemental calcium intake at age 13 and body mass index (BMI) at age 21 after the analysis was adjusted for energy intake . The study also found no associations between consumption of dairy foods (milk, yogurt, and cheese) at age 13 and BMI at age 21. Clinical trials and meta-analyses of RCTs assessing the impact of calcium supplements or increased intakes of calcium from dairy products on prevention of weight gain or promotion of fat loss or weight loss have had mixed results [89-93]. For example, postmenopausal women who took 1,000 mg calcium and 400 IU (10 mcg) vitamin D daily for 3 years in the WHI whose daily intakes were less than 1,200 mg calcium at baseline were 11% less likely to gain 1 kg of weight or more than those who took placebo during this period . A systematic review and meta-analysis of 41 RCTs that examined the effect of dairy foods or calcium supplements (at least 300 mg/day) in 4,802 adults found that higher calcium intakes from dairy foods had no impact on body weight or body fat, although they did reduce body fat when combined with an energy-restricted diet . In addition, calcium supplements had no effect on body weight or body fat. For additional information on calcium and weight management, see the health professional fact sheet on weight loss. Metabolic syndrome Metabolic syndrome is a set of at least three risk factors for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes—large waistline, high triglyceride level, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, high blood pressure, and high fasting blood sugar level. Some observational evidence links higher calcium intakes with lower risk of metabolic syndrome. An analysis of 2001–2010 NHANES data on 9,148 adults found that women in the highest quintile (at least 1,172 mg/day) of calcium intake, based on 24-hour recall, had a 27% lower risk of metabolic syndrome than those in the lowest quintile (less than 547 mg/day) . Furthermore, women who met the RDA for calcium for adults (1,000 to 1,200 mg/day, depending on age) had an 18% lower risk of metabolic syndrome, but the association was not statistically significant in men who met the RDA for calcium. In a meta-analysis of eight cross-sectional studies and two prospective cohort studies in 63,017 participants age 20 years and older, 14,906 participants developed metabolic syndrome . For each 300 mg/day increase in dietary calcium intake, risk of metabolic syndrome dropped by 7%. Subgroup analyses suggested that the inverse association between dietary calcium intakes and metabolic syndrome risk was stronger in women than men. Clinical trial evidence on the link between calcium and metabolic syndrome is very limited. In one placebo-controlled clinical trial in Iran in 66 adults who were overweight and had type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease, supplements of 5 mcg (200 IU) vitamin D, 90 mcg vitamin K, and 500 mg calcium for 12 weeks significantly reduced maximum levels of left carotid intima media thickness and improved metabolic status (including improvements in insulin resistance, insulin concentrations, beta-cell function, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index) . More evidence, including from well-designed clinical trials, is needed to determine whether higher intakes of calcium can reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome. Health Risks from Excessive Calcium Hypercalcemia (serum levels greater than 10.5 mg/dL [2.63 mmol/L]) and hypercalciuria (urinary calcium levels higher than 250 mg/day in women and 275 mg/day in men) are rare in healthy people and usually result from cancer, primary hyperparathyroidism, and other conditions . Hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria can cause poor muscle tone, renal insufficiency, hypophosphatemia, constipation, nausea, weight loss, fatigue, polyuria, heart arrhythmias, and a higher risk of CVD mortality . High calcium intakes might also increase the risk of CVD (see section on CVD in Calcium and Health section above) and prostate cancer (see Other Cancers in Calcium and Health section above for more details) , although not all studies confirm these findings. The ULs for calcium established by the FNB are listed in Table 3. They are based on observational evidence from the WHI showing a link between higher intakes of supplemental calcium (1,000 mg/day for 7 years) and a greater risk of kidney stones . However, two subsequent systematic reviews of the evidence from 10 studies in more than 8,000 adults with osteoporosis who took 120 to 1,500 mg supplemental calcium daily for 3 days to 3 years and 11 RCTs in 51,419 adults 50 years and older who took 1,000 to 1,600 mg calcium with or without vitamin D for 2 to 7 years found no such association. Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Calcium 0–6 months: Male: 1,000 mg, Female: 1,000 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  7–12 months: Male: 1,500 mg, Female: 1,500 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  1–8 years: Male: 2,500 mg, Female: 2,500 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  9–18 years: Male: 3,000 mg, Female: 3,000 mg, Pregnant: 3,000 mg, Lactating: 3,000 mg 19–50 years: Male: 2,500 mg, Female: 2,500 mg, Pregnant: 2,500 mg, Lactating: 2,500 mg 51+ years: Male: 2,000 mg, Female: 2,000 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  Interactions with Medications Calcium has the potential to interact with certain medications, and several types of medications might adversely affect calcium levels. A few examples are provided below. Individuals taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their calcium status with their health care providers. Dolutegravir Dolutegravir (Dovato, Tivicay) is an HIV integrase inhibitor used in adults and children. Concomitant use of calcium supplements and dolutegravir can reduce blood levels of dolutegravir substantially, apparently through chelation . The labels approved by the FDA for dolutegravir advise patients to take dolutegravir 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking calcium supplements . Levothyroxine Calcium carbonate supplements can interfere with the absorption of levothyroxine (Synthroid, Levoxyl, and others), a thyroid hormone used to treat hypothyroidism and thyroid cancer [104-106]. The FDA-approved label for this medication instructs patients taking calcium carbonate supplements to avoid taking levothyroxine within 4 hours of taking the supplement . Lithium Long-term use of lithium (Eskalith, Lithobid), a treatment for bipolar disorder, can lead to hypercalcemia, and use of both lithium and calcium supplements could increase this risk . Quinolone antibiotics Simultaneous use of calcium supplements and quinolone antibiotics—such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro), gemifloxacin (Factive), and moxifloxacin (Avelox)—can reduce the absorption of quinolones . Taking the antibiotic 2 hours before or 2 hours after calcium supplements prevents this effect . Calcium and Healthful Diets The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that “Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. … In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy). For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA’s MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy eating pattern as one that • Includes a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products, and oils. Many dairy products, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt, are rich sources of calcium. Some vegetables provide significant amounts of calcium, as do some fortified cereals and juices. • Many dairy products, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt, are rich sources of calcium. Some vegetables provide significant amounts of calcium, as do some fortified cereals and juices. • Includes a variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), nuts, seeds, and soy products. Tofu made with calcium salts is a good source of calcium (check the label), as are canned sardines and canned salmon with edible bones. • Tofu made with calcium salts is a good source of calcium (check the label), as are canned sardines and canned salmon with edible bones. • Limits foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. • Limits alcoholic beverages. • Stays within your daily calorie needs. • Many dairy products, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt, are rich sources of calcium.

      "content": "Introduction Magnesium, an abundant mineral in the body, is naturally present in many foods, added to other food products, available as a dietary supplement, and present in some medicines (such as antacids and laxatives). Magnesium is a cofactor in more than 300 enzyme systems that regulate diverse biochemical reactions in the body, including protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation [1-3]. Magnesium is required for energy production, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis. It contributes to the structural development of bone and is required for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and the antioxidant glutathione. Magnesium also plays a role in the active transport of calcium and potassium ions across cell membranes, a process that is important to nerve impulse conduction, muscle contraction, and normal heart rhythm . An adult body contains approximately 25 g magnesium, with 50% to 60% present in the bones and most of the rest in soft tissues . Less than 1% of total magnesium is in blood serum, and these levels are kept under tight control. Normal serum magnesium concentrations range between 0.75 and 0.95 millimoles (mmol)/L . Hypomagnesemia is defined as a serum magnesium level less than 0.75 mmol/L . Magnesium homeostasis is largely controlled by the kidney, which typically excretes about 120 mg magnesium into the urine each day . Urinary excretion is reduced when magnesium status is low . Assessing magnesium status is difficult because most magnesium is inside cells or in bone . The most commonly used and readily available method for assessing magnesium status is measurement of serum magnesium concentration, even though serum levels have little correlation with total body magnesium levels or concentrations in specific tissues . Other methods for assessing magnesium status include measuring magnesium concentrations in erythrocytes, saliva, and urine; measuring ionized magnesium concentrations in blood, plasma, or serum; and conducting a magnesium-loading (or tolerance) test. No single method is considered satisfactory . Some experts but not others consider the tolerance test (in which urinary magnesium is measured after parenteral infusion of a dose of magnesium) to be the best method to assess magnesium status in adults. To comprehensively evaluate magnesium status, both laboratory tests and a clinical assessment might be required . Recommended Intakes Intake recommendations for magnesium and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (formerly National Academy of Sciences) . DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used to plan and assess nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include the following: • Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): Average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%–98%) healthy individuals; often used to plan nutritionally adequate diets for individuals • Adequate Intake (AI): Intake at this level is assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy; established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA • Estimated Average Requirement (EAR): Average daily level of intake estimated to meet the requirements of 50% of healthy individuals; usually used to assess the nutrient intakes of groups of people and to plan nutritionally adequate diets for them; can also be used to assess the nutrient intakes of individuals • Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): Maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse health effects Table 1 lists the current RDAs for magnesium . For infants from birth to 12 months, the FNB established an AI for magnesium that is equivalent to the mean intake of magnesium in healthy, breastfed infants, with added solid foods for ages 7–12 months. Table 1: Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for Magnesium Birth to 6 months: Male: 30 mg*, Female: 30 mg*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  7–12 months: Male: 75 mg*, Female: 75 mg*, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  1–3 years: Male: 80 mg, Female: 80 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  4–8 years: Male: 130 mg, Female: 130 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  9–13 years: Male: 240 mg, Female: 240 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  14–18 years: Male: 410 mg, Female: 360 mg, Pregnancy: 400 mg, Lactation: 360 mg 19–30 years: Male: 400 mg, Female: 310 mg, Pregnancy: 350 mg, Lactation: 310 mg 31–50 years: Male: 420 mg, Female: 320 mg, Pregnancy: 360 mg, Lactation: 320 mg 51+ years: Male: 420 mg, Female: 320 mg, Pregnancy: , Lactation:  *Adequate Intake (AI) Sources of Magnesium Food Magnesium is widely distributed in plant and animal foods and in beverages. Green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains, are good sources . In general, foods containing dietary fiber provide magnesium. Magnesium is also added to some breakfast cereals and other fortified foods. Some types of food processing, such as refining grains in ways that remove the nutrient-rich germ and bran, lower magnesium content substantially . Selected food sources of magnesium are listed in Table 2. Tap, mineral, and bottled waters can also be sources of magnesium, but the amount of magnesium in water varies by source and brand (ranging from 1 mg/L to more than 120 mg/L) . Approximately 30% to 40% of the dietary magnesium consumed is typically absorbed by the body . Table 2: Magnesium Content of Selected Foods Pumpkin seeds, roasted, 1 ounce: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 156, Percent DV*: 37 Chia seeds, 1 ounce: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 111, Percent DV*: 26 Almonds, dry roasted, 1 ounce: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 80, Percent DV*: 19 Spinach, boiled, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 78, Percent DV*: 19 Cashews, dry roasted, 1 ounce: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 74, Percent DV*: 18 Peanuts, oil roasted, ¼ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 63, Percent DV*: 15 Cereal, shredded wheat, 2 large biscuits: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 61, Percent DV*: 15 Soymilk, plain or vanilla, 1 cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 61, Percent DV*: 15 Black beans, cooked, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 60, Percent DV*: 14 Edamame, shelled, cooked, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 50, Percent DV*: 12 Peanut butter, smooth, 2 tablespoons: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 49, Percent DV*: 12 Potato, baked with skin, 3.5 ounces: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 43, Percent DV*: 10 Rice, brown, cooked, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 42, Percent DV*: 10 Yogurt, plain, low fat, 8 ounces: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 42, Percent DV*: 10 Breakfast cereals, fortified with 10% of the DV for magnesium, 1 serving: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 42, Percent DV*: 10 Oatmeal, instant, 1 packet: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 36, Percent DV*: 9 Kidney beans, canned, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 35, Percent DV*: 8 Banana, 1 medium: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 32, Percent DV*: 8 Salmon, Atlantic, farmed, cooked, 3 ounces: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 26, Percent DV*: 6 Milk, 1 cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 24–27, Percent DV*: 6 Halibut, cooked, 3 ounces: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 24, Percent DV*: 6 Raisins, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 23, Percent DV*: 5 Bread, whole wheat, 1 slice: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 23, Percent DV*: 5 Avocado, cubed, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 22, Percent DV*: 5 Chicken breast, roasted, 3 ounces: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 22, Percent DV*: 5 Beef, ground, 90% lean, pan broiled, 3 ounces: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 20, Percent DV*: 5 Broccoli, chopped and cooked, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 12, Percent DV*: 3 Rice, white, cooked, ½ cup: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 10, Percent DV*: 2 Apple, 1 medium: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 9, Percent DV*: 2 Carrot, raw, 1 medium: Milligrams (mg) per serving: 7, Percent DV*: 2 *DV = Daily Value. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed DVs to help consumers compare the nutrient contents of foods and dietary supplements within the context of a total diet. The DV for magnesium is 420 mg for adults and children age 4 years and older . FDA does not require food labels to list magnesium content unless magnesium has been added to the food. Foods providing 20% or more of the DV are considered to be high sources of a nutrient, but foods providing lower percentages of the DV also contribute to a healthful diet. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) FoodData Central lists the nutrient content of many foods and provides comprehensive list of foods containing magnesium arranged by nutrient content and by food name. Dietary supplements Magnesium supplements are available in a variety of forms, including magnesium oxide, citrate, and chloride . The Supplement Facts panel on a dietary supplement label declares the amount of elemental magnesium in the product, not the weight of the entire magnesium-containing compound. Absorption of magnesium from different kinds of magnesium supplements varies. Forms of magnesium that dissolve well in liquid are more completely absorbed in the gut than less soluble forms . Small studies have found that magnesium in the aspartate, citrate, lactate, and chloride forms is absorbed more completely and is more bioavailable than magnesium oxide and magnesium sulfate [12-16]. One study found that very high doses of zinc from supplements (142 mg/day) can interfere with magnesium absorption and disrupt the magnesium balance in the body . Medicines Magnesium is a primary ingredient in some laxatives . Phillips’ Milk of Magnesia, for example, provides 500 mg elemental magnesium (as magnesium hydroxide) per tablespoon; the directions advise taking up to 4 tablespoons/day for adolescents and adults . (Although such a dose of magnesium is well above the safe upper level, some of the magnesium is not absorbed because of the medication’s laxative effect.) Magnesium is also included in some remedies for heartburn and upset stomach due to acid indigestion . Extra-strength Rolaids, for example, provides 55 mg elemental magnesium (as magnesium hydroxide) per tablet , although Tums is magnesium free . Magnesium Intakes and Status Dietary surveys of people in the United States consistently show that many people consume less than recommended amounts of magnesium. An analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of 2013–2016 found that 48% of Americans of all ages ingest less magnesium from food and beverages than their respective EARs; adult men age 71 years and older and adolescent males and females are most likely to have low intakes . In a study using data from NHANES 2003–2006 to assess mineral intakes among adults, average intakes of magnesium from food alone were higher among users of dietary supplements (350 mg for men and 267 mg for women, equal to or slightly exceeding their respective EARs) than among nonusers (268 mg for men and 234 for women) . When supplements were included, average total intakes of magnesium were 449 mg for men and 387 mg for women, well above EAR levels. No current data on magnesium status in the United States are available. Determining dietary intake of magnesium is the usual proxy for assessing magnesium status. NHANES has not determined serum magnesium levels in its participants since 1974 , and magnesium is not evaluated in routine electrolyte testing in hospitals and clinics . Magnesium Deficiency Symptomatic magnesium deficiency due to low dietary intake in otherwise-healthy people is uncommon because the kidneys limit urinary excretion of this mineral . However, habitually low intakes or excessive losses of magnesium due to certain health conditions, chronic alcoholism, and/or the use of certain medications can lead to magnesium deficiency. Early signs of magnesium deficiency include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness. As magnesium deficiency worsens, numbness, tingling, muscle contractions and cramps, seizures, personality changes, abnormal heart rhythms, and coronary spasms can occur . Severe magnesium deficiency can result in hypocalcemia or hypokalemia (low serum calcium or potassium levels, respectively) because mineral homeostasis is disrupted . Groups at Risk of Magnesium Inadequacy Magnesium inadequacy can occur when intakes fall below the RDA but are above the amount required to prevent overt deficiency. The following groups are more likely than others to be at risk of magnesium inadequacy because they typically consume insufficient amounts or they have medical conditions (or take medications) that reduce magnesium absorption from the gut or increase losses from the body. People with gastrointestinal diseases The chronic diarrhea and fat malabsorption resulting from Crohn’s disease, gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac disease), and regional enteritis can lead to magnesium depletion over time . Resection or bypass of the small intestine, especially the ileum, typically leads to malabsorption and magnesium loss . People with type 2 diabetes Magnesium deficits and increased urinary magnesium excretion can occur in people with insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes . The magnesium loss appears to be secondary to higher concentrations of glucose in the kidney that increase urine output . People with alcohol dependence Magnesium deficiency is common in people with chronic alcoholism . In these individuals, poor dietary intake and nutritional status; gastrointestinal problems, including vomiting, diarrhea, and steatorrhea (fatty stools) resulting from pancreatitis; renal dysfunction with excess excretion of magnesium into the urine; phosphate depletion; vitamin D deficiency; acute alcoholic ketoacidosis; and hyperaldosteronism secondary to liver disease can all contribute to decreased magnesium status . Older adults Older adults have lower dietary intakes of magnesium than younger adults . In addition, magnesium absorption from the gut decreases and renal magnesium excretion increases with age . Older adults are also more likely to have chronic diseases or take medications that alter magnesium status, which can increase their risk of magnesium depletion . Magnesium and Health Habitually low intakes of magnesium induce changes in biochemical pathways that can increase the risk of illness over time. This section focuses on four diseases and disorders in which magnesium might be involved: hypertension and cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and migraine headaches. Hypertension and cardiovascular disease Hypertension is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Studies to date, however, have found that magnesium supplementation lowers blood pressure, at best, to only a small extent. A meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials found that magnesium supplementation for 8–26 weeks in 545 hypertensive participants resulted in only a small reduction (2.2 mmHg) in diastolic blood pressure . The dose of magnesium ranged from approximately 243 to 973 mg/day. The authors of another meta-analysis of 22 studies with 1,173 normotensive and hypertensive adults concluded that magnesium supplementation for 3–24 weeks decreased systolic blood pressure by 3–4 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 2–3 mmHg . The effects were somewhat larger when supplemental magnesium intakes of the participants in the nine crossover-design trials exceeded 370 mg/day. A diet containing more magnesium because of added fruits and vegetables, more low-fat or nonfat dairy products, and less fat overall was shown to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure by an average of 5.5 and 3.0 mmHg, respectively . However, this Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet also increases intakes of other nutrients, such as potassium and calcium, that are associated with reductions in blood pressure, so any independent contribution of magnesium cannot be determined. In 2022, FDA approved a qualified health claim for conventional foods and dietary supplements that contain magnesium . One example of this claim states, “Consuming diets with adequate magnesium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure (hypertension). However, FDA has concluded that the evidence is inconsistent and inconclusive.” FDA also specifies that foods and dietary supplements carrying this claim on their labels must provide at least 84 mg of magnesium per serving and, for dietary supplements, no more than 350 mg. Several prospective studies have examined associations between magnesium intakes and heart disease. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study assessed heart disease risk factors and levels of serum magnesium in a cohort of 14,232 White and African-American men and women age 45 to 64 years at baseline . Over an average of 12 years of follow-up, individuals in the highest quartile of the normal physiologic range of serum magnesium (at least 0.88 mmol/L) had a 38% reduced risk of sudden cardiac death compared with individuals in the lowest quartile (0.75 mmol/L or less). However, dietary magnesium intakes had no association with risk of sudden cardiac death. Another prospective study tracked 88,375 female nurses in the United States to determine whether serum magnesium levels measured early in the study and magnesium intakes from food and supplements assessed every 2 to 4 years were associated with sudden cardiac death over 26 years of follow-up . Women in the highest compared with the lowest quartile of ingested and plasma magnesium concentrations had a 34% and 77% lower risk of sudden cardiac death, respectively. Another prospective population study of 7,664 adults age 20 to 75 years in the Netherlands who did not have cardiovascular disease found that low urinary magnesium excretion levels (a marker for low dietary magnesium intake) were associated with a higher risk of ischemic heart disease over a median follow-up period of 10.5 years. Plasma magnesium concentrations were not associated with risk of ischemic heart disease . A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies found that higher serum levels of magnesium were significantly associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, and higher dietary magnesium intakes (up to approximately 250 mg/day) were associated with a significantly lower risk of ischemic heart disease caused by a reduced blood supply to the heart muscle . Higher magnesium intakes might reduce the risk of stroke. In a meta-analysis of seven prospective trials with a total of 241,378 participants, an additional 100 mg/day magnesium in the diet was associated with an 8% decreased risk of total stroke, especially ischemic rather than hemorrhagic stroke . One limitation of such observational studies, however, is the possibility of confounding with other nutrients or dietary components that could also affect the risk of stroke. A large, well-designed clinical trial is needed to better understand the contributions of magnesium from food and dietary supplements to heart health and the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease . Type 2 diabetes Diets with higher amounts of magnesium are associated with a significantly lower risk of diabetes, possibly because of the important role of magnesium in glucose metabolism . Hypomagnesemia might worsen insulin resistance, a condition that often precedes diabetes, or it might be a consequence of insulin resistance . Diabetes leads to increased urinary losses of magnesium, and the subsequent magnesium inadequacy might impair insulin secretion and action, thereby worsening diabetes control . Most investigations of magnesium intake and risk of type 2 diabetes have been prospective cohort studies. A meta-analysis of seven of these studies, which included 286,668 patients and 10,912 cases of diabetes over 6 to 17 years of follow-up, found that a 100 mg/day increase in total magnesium intake decreased the risk of diabetes by a statistically significant 15% . Another meta-analysis of eight prospective cohort studies that followed 271,869 men and women over 4 to 18 years found a significant inverse association between magnesium intake from food and risk of type 2 diabetes; the relative risk reduction was 23% when the highest to lowest intakes were compared . A 2011 meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies of the association between magnesium intake and risk of type 2 diabetes included 13 studies with a total of 536,318 participants and 24,516 cases of diabetes . The mean length of follow-up ranged from 4 to 20 years. Investigators found an inverse association between magnesium intake and risk of type 2 diabetes in a dose-responsive fashion, but this association achieved statistical significance only in individuals who were overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25 or higher) but not in normal-weight individuals (BMI less than 25). Again, a limitation of these observational studies is the possibility of confounding with other dietary components or lifestyle or environmental variables that are correlated with magnesium intake. Only a few small, short-term clinical trials have examined the potential effects of supplemental magnesium on control of type 2 diabetes and the results are conflicting . For example, 128 patients with poorly controlled diabetes in a Brazilian clinical trial received a placebo or a supplement containing either 500 mg/day or 1,000 mg/day magnesium oxide (providing 300 or 600 mg elemental magnesium, respectively) . After 30 days of supplementation, plasma, cellular, and urine magnesium levels increased in participants receiving the larger dose of the supplement, and their glycemic control improved. In another small trial in Mexico, participants with type 2 diabetes and hypomagnesemia who received a liquid supplement of magnesium chloride (providing 300 mg/day elemental magnesium) for 16 weeks showed significant reductions in fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations compared with participants receiving a placebo, and their serum magnesium levels became normal . In contrast, neither a supplement of magnesium aspartate (providing 369 mg/day elemental magnesium) nor a placebo taken for 3 months had any effect on glycemic control in 50 patients with type 2 diabetes who were taking insulin . The American Diabetes Association states that there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of magnesium to improve glycemic control in people with diabetes . It further notes that there is no clear scientific evidence that vitamin and mineral supplementation benefits people with diabetes who do not have underlying nutritional deficiencies. Osteoporosis Magnesium is involved in bone formation and influences the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts . Magnesium also affects the concentrations of both parathyroid hormone and the active form of vitamin D, which are major regulators of bone homeostasis. Several population-based studies have found positive associations between magnesium intake and bone mineral density in both men and women . Other research has found that women with osteoporosis have lower serum magnesium levels than women with osteopenia and those who do not have osteoporosis or osteopenia . These and other findings indicate that magnesium deficiency might be a risk factor for osteoporosis . Although limited in number, studies suggest that increasing magnesium intakes from food or supplements might increase bone mineral density in postmenopausal and elderly women . For example, one short-term study found that 290 mg/day elemental magnesium (as magnesium citrate) for 30 days in 20 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis suppressed bone turnover compared with placebo, suggesting that bone loss decreased . Diets that provide recommended levels of magnesium enhance bone health, but further research is needed to elucidate the role of magnesium in the prevention and management of osteoporosis. Migraine headaches Magnesium deficiency is related to factors that promote headaches, including neurotransmitter release and vasoconstriction . People who experience migraine headaches have lower levels of serum and tissue magnesium than those who do not. However, research on the use of magnesium supplements to prevent or reduce symptoms of migraine headaches is limited. Three of four small, short-term, placebo-controlled trials found modest reductions in the frequency of migraines in patients given up to 600 mg/day magnesium . The authors of a review on migraine prophylaxis suggested that taking 300 mg magnesium twice a day, either alone or in combination with medication, can prevent migraines . In their evidence-based guideline update, the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society concluded that magnesium therapy is probably effective for migraine prevention . Because the typical dose of magnesium used for migraine prevention exceeds the UL, this treatment should be used only under the direction and supervision of a health care provider. Health Risks from Excessive Magnesium Too much magnesium from food does not pose a health risk in healthy individuals because the kidneys eliminate excess amounts in the urine . However, high doses of magnesium from dietary supplements or medications often result in diarrhea that can be accompanied by nausea and abdominal cramping . Forms of magnesium most commonly reported to cause diarrhea include magnesium carbonate, chloride, gluconate, and oxide . The diarrhea and laxative effects of magnesium salts are due to the osmotic activity of unabsorbed salts in the intestine and colon and the stimulation of gastric motility . Very large doses of magnesium-containing laxatives and antacids (typically providing more than 5,000 mg/day magnesium) have been associated with magnesium toxicity , including fatal hypermagnesemia in a 28-month-old boy and an elderly man . Symptoms of magnesium toxicity, which usually develop after serum concentrations exceed 1.74–2.61 mmol/L, can include hypotension, nausea, vomiting, facial flushing, retention of urine, ileus, depression, and lethargy before progressing to muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, extreme hypotension, irregular heartbeat, and cardiac arrest . The risk of magnesium toxicity increases with impaired renal function or kidney failure because the ability to remove excess magnesium is reduced or lost . The FNB has established ULs for supplemental magnesium for healthy infants, children, and adults (see Table 3) . For many age groups, the UL appears to be lower than the RDA. This occurs because the RDAs include magnesium from all sources—food, beverages, dietary supplements, and medications. The ULs include magnesium from only dietary supplements and medications; they do not include magnesium found naturally in food and beverages. Table 3: Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for Supplemental Magnesium Birth to 12 months: Male: None established, Female: None established, Pregnant: , Lactating:  1–3 years: Male: 65 mg, Female: 65 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  4–8 years: Male: 110 mg, Female: 110 mg, Pregnant: , Lactating:  9–18 years: Male: 350 mg, Female: 350 mg, Pregnant: 350 mg, Lactating: 350 mg 19+ years: Male: 350 mg, Female: 350 mg, Pregnant: 350 mg, Lactating: 350 mg Interactions with Medications Several types of medications have the potential to interact with magnesium supplements or affect magnesium status. A few examples are provided below. People taking these and other medications on a regular basis should discuss their magnesium intakes with their health care providers. Bisphosphonates Magnesium-rich supplements or medications can decrease the absorption of oral bisphosphonates, such as alendronate (Fosamax), used to treat osteoporosis . Use of magnesium-rich supplements or medications and oral bisphosphonates should be separated by at least 2 hours . Antibiotics Magnesium can form insoluble complexes with tetracyclines, such as demeclocycline (Declomycin) and doxycycline (Vibramycin) as well as quinolone antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and levofloxacin (Levaquin). These antibiotics should be taken at least 2 hours before or 4–6 hours after a magnesium-containing supplement . Diuretics Chronic treatment with loop diuretics, such as furosemide (Lasix) and bumetanide (Bumex), and thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide (Aquazide H) and ethacrynic acid (Edecrin), can increase the loss of magnesium in urine and lead to magnesium depletion . In contrast, potassium-sparing diuretics, such as amiloride (Midamor) and spironolactone (Aldactone), reduce magnesium excretion . Proton pump inhibitors Prescription proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs, such as esomeprazole magnesium (Nexium) and lansoprazole (Prevacid), when taken for prolonged periods (typically more than a year) can cause hypomagnesemia . In cases that FDA reviewed, magnesium supplements often raised the low serum magnesium levels caused by PPIs. However, in 25% of the cases, supplements did not raise magnesium levels and the patients had to discontinue the PPI. FDA advises health care professionals to consider measuring patients’ serum magnesium levels prior to initiating long-term PPI treatment and to check magnesium levels in these patients periodically . Magnesium and Healthful Diets The federal government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans notes that “Because foods provide an array of nutrients and other components that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. … In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).” For more information about building a healthy dietary pattern, refer to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the USDA’s MyPlate. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans describes a healthy dietary pattern as one that • Includes a variety of vegetables; fruits; grains (at least half whole grains); fat-free and low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese; and oils. Whole grains and dark-green, leafy vegetables are good sources of magnesium. Low-fat milk and yogurt contain magnesium as well. Some ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are fortified with magnesium. • Whole grains and dark-green, leafy vegetables are good sources of magnesium. Low-fat milk and yogurt contain magnesium as well.

      "content": "Introduction The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics defines probiotics as “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host” . These microorganisms, which consist mainly of bacteria but also include yeasts, are present in some fermented foods (e.g., yogurt), are added to certain food products, and are available as dietary supplements. However, not all foods and dietary supplements that are labeled as probiotics have proven health benefits. Probiotics should not be confused with prebiotics, which are typically complex carbohydrates (such as inulin and other fructo-oligosaccharides) that microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract use as metabolic fuel . Commercial products containing both prebiotics and probiotic microorganisms are often called synbiotics. Probiotics should also not be confused with postbiotics, which are preparations comprised of dead, intact, or fragmented microorganisms, with or without their metabolites, that confer a health benefit on the host . Identification Probiotics are identified by their genus, species, and strain designation; some probiotics also receive subspecies names. Probiotic products often contain microbial organisms from the genera Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Escherichia, and Bacillus and from the family Lactobacillaceae. Probiotics are identified by their specific strain, which includes the genus, the species, the subspecies (if applicable), and an alphanumeric strain designation . Microbial organisms from the genera Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Escherichia, and Bacillus are commonly used in probiotic products. In addition, products commonly contain microbes from the family Lactobacillaceae, which includes several species that were formerly in the Lactobacillus genus before that genus was restructured in 2020 . When reporting the results from specific studies, this fact sheet maintains the original genus names that were in use at the time the research was conducted. Table 1 shows examples of the nomenclature used for several commercial strains of probiotic organisms. Table 1: Nomenclature for sample commercial strains of probiotics Lacticaseibacillus(formerly Lactobacillus): Species: rhamnosus, Subspecies: None, Strain Designation: GG, Strain Nickname: LGG Bifidobacterium: Species: animalis, Subspecies: lactis, Strain Designation: DN-173 010, Strain Nickname: Bifidus regularis Bifidobacterium: Species: longum, Subspecies: longum, Strain Designation: 35624, Strain Nickname: Bifantis Mechanisms of action Probiotics exert their health effects through a wide variety of mechanisms. Some of these mechanisms, such as inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract, are widely shared among probiotic strains. Other mechanisms are unique to a particular species or strain. The human gastrointestinal tract is colonized by many microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. The activity and composition of these microorganisms (collectively known as the gut microbiota, microbiome, or intestinal microflora) can affect human health and disease. Probiotics are consumed orally and exert their effects in the gastrointestinal tract, where they may influence the intestinal microbiota. Probiotics may transiently colonize the human gut mucosa in highly individualized patterns, depending on the baseline microbiota, probiotic strain, and gastrointestinal tract region . Probiotics also exert health effects by nonspecific, species-specific, and strain-specific mechanisms. The nonspecific mechanisms vary widely among the strains, species, or even genera of commonly used probiotic supplements. These mechanisms include the inhibition of the growth of pathogenic microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract (by fostering colonization resistance, improving intestinal transit, producing antimicrobial substances, or helping normalize a perturbed microbiota), production of bioactive metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids), and the reduction of luminal pH in the colon . Species-specific mechanisms can include vitamin synthesis, gut barrier reinforcement, bile salt metabolism, enzymatic activity, and toxin neutralization. Other mechanisms, such as cytokine production, specific immunomodulatory activities, and effects on the endocrine and nervous systems, are expressed in a strain-specific manner. Because the effects of probiotics can be specific to certain probiotic strains, recommendations for their use in the clinic need to be strain-specific . Additionally, researchers should take probiotic strains into account when designing studies and when pooling data from studies that may have used different probiotic strains to avoid misleading conclusions about their efficacy and safety. Sources of Probiotics Food Some types of fermented foods, such as yogurt, are potential sources of beneficial microbes, though not all fermented foods that contain live cultures have probiotic microorganisms. Probiotic microorganisms are also sometimes added to unfermented foods. Fermented foods are made through the growth and metabolic activity of a variety of live microbial cultures . Many of these foods are rich sources of live and potentially beneficial microbes. Some fermented foods, such as sourdough bread and most commercial pickles, are processed after they are fermented and do not contain live cultures when consumed. Yogurt, another type of fermented food, is made using Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Yogurt may also contain probiotic microorganisms from Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillaceae. Fermented foods that contain live cultures but do not typically contain proven probiotic microorganisms include many cheeses, kimchi (a Korean fermented cabbage dish), kombucha (a fermented tea), sauerkraut (fermented cabbage), miso (a fermented soybean-based paste), pickles, and raw unfiltered apple cider vinegar made from fermented apple sugars . Certain unfermented foods, such as milks, juices, smoothies, cereals, nutrition bars, and infant and toddler formulas, might be formulated with added probiotics. Typically, these probiotics are indicated on the label, with a strain designation and the number of viable microorganisms. Dietary supplements Dietary supplements that contain probiotics can include from one to many strains. The number of viable cells in a probiotic supplement is indicated by the number of colony-forming units (CFU) listed on the label. However, it can be difficult to determine which products offer verifiable health benefits due to the wide variety of probiotic strains and doses found in probiotic products and inconsistent labeling practices and recommendations for use. Probiotics are available as dietary supplements (in capsules, powders, liquids, and other forms) that contain a wide variety of strains and doses . Products can include single strains or multiple strains of live microorganisms. The effects of many commercial products that contain probiotics have not been examined in research studies, and it is difficult for people who are not familiar with probiotic research to determine which products are backed by evidence . However, some organizations have systematically reviewed the available evidence and developed recommendations for using specific probiotics—including the appropriate product, dose, and formulation—to prevent or treat various health conditions . Probiotics are measured in CFU, which indicate the number of viable cells. Amounts may be written on product labels as, for example, 1 x 109 for 1 billion CFU or 1 x 1010 for 10 billion CFU. Many probiotic supplements contain 1 to 10 billion CFU per dose, but some products contain 50 billion CFU or more. However, products with higher CFU counts are not necessarily more effective than products with a lower CFU count. Current labeling regulations only require manufacturers to list the total weight of the microorganisms on probiotic products’ Supplement Facts labels; this cellular mass can consist of both live and dead microorganisms and, therefore, has no relationship with the number of viable microorganisms in the product . Manufacturers may voluntarily list the CFU in a product in addition to the total microorganism weight on the Supplement Facts label. Because probiotics must be consumed alive to have health benefits and they can die during their shelf life, users should look for products labeled with the number of CFU at the end of the product’s shelf life, not at the time of manufacture. Probiotics and Health The potential health benefits of probiotics are the focus of a great deal of scientific research. This section focuses on eight health conditions: atopic dermatitis, pediatric acute infectious diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), hypercholesterolemia, and obesity. For information on probiotics and the common cold, influenza, and other respiratory tract infections, please see the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) health professional fact sheet, Dietary Supplements for Immune Function and Infectious Diseases. Atopic dermatitis Studies have evaluated the use of various probiotic products to prevent atopic dermatitis, a common inflammatory skin disorder. The results of these studies suggest that probiotics may reduce the risk of developing atopic dermatitis and the severity of symptoms, though the relief these products can provide may be limited. Atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema, is also one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin disorders, affecting approximately 15% to 20% of children and 1% to 3% of adults worldwide . Numerous probiotic studies have evaluated the effects of various species and strains of bacteria on the prevention of atopic dermatitis, and several meta-analyses have synthesized the findings of these studies. These studies and meta-analyses show that exposure to probiotics during pregnancy and in early infancy might reduce the risk of developing atopic dermatitis in children. For example, a 2018 meta-analysis included 27 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one controlled cohort study in a total of 6,907 infants and children who were exposed to probiotics in utero for 2 weeks to 7 months (via maternal oral supplementation) and/or by oral administration to the infants after birth for 2 to 13 months . The results showed that between age 6 months and 9 years, probiotic treatment with single strains or mixtures that included Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Propionibacterium strains significantly reduced the risk of atopic dermatitis from 34.7% in the control group to 28.5% in the probiotic group. Subgroup analyses showed that the use of probiotics during both the prenatal and postnatal periods significantly reduced the incidence of dermatitis; however, taking probiotics during only the prenatal or postnatal period did not. In addition, the effects of probiotic treatment varied by strain. For example, supplementation with either Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Lactobacillus paracasei significantly reduced the incidence of atopic dermatitis, whereas supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri or Lactobacillus acidophilus did not. In contrast, another meta-analysis of five RCTs with a total of 889 participants found that Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) supplementation did not reduce the risk of eczema in children up to age 4 years, regardless of whether the children received probiotics directly or were exposed to probiotics in utero and/or during breastfeeding via maternal supplementation . Most published meta-analyses have shown that probiotics slightly reduce the severity of atopic dermatitis symptoms in infants and children. For example, a meta-analysis of 13 RCTs with a total of 1,070 participants age 18 years or younger found that probiotic treatment for 4 to 8 weeks significantly reduced SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) values, indicating reduced symptom severity . Subgroup analyses found that probiotics had protective effects in children age 1 to 18 years (nine trials) but not in infants younger than 1 year (five trials). In addition, treatment with Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus fermentum, or a mixture of probiotic strains significantly reduced SCORAD values in the children, whereas LGG and Lactobacillus plantarum had no effect. Another meta-analysis included eight RCTs with a total of 741 participants from birth to 36 months of age who were treated with Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium for 4 to 24 weeks . Probiotics that contained Lactobacillus reduced the severity of atopic dermatitis symptoms in infants and toddlers, but those containing Bifidobacterium did not. In addition, the treatment significantly improved symptoms in participants with moderate-to-severe forms of the disease but not in those with mild forms. A Cochrane Review of 39 RCTs of single probiotics and probiotic mixtures that were used to treat eczema in 2,599 participants age 1 to 55 years (most were children) found that probiotic treatment might slightly reduce SCORAD scores . However, the researchers concluded that the differences were not clinically significant and that the current evidence does not support the use of probiotics for eczema treatment. Overall, the available evidence suggests that the use of probiotics might reduce the risk of developing atopic dermatitis and lead to significant reductions in atopic dermatitis SCORAD scores, but these products might provide only limited relief from the condition. Furthermore, the effects of probiotics vary by the strain used, the timing of administration, and the patient’s age, so it is difficult to make recommendations. Pediatric acute infectious diarrhea Some evidence supports using certain probiotics to manage acute infectious diarrhea in pediatric patients; a few reviews have shown that some probiotics reduce the duration of acute diarrhea. However, not all trials concur with these results, and it is unclear whether probiotic supplements are an effective method for managing this condition in developed countries. Acute diarrhea is usually defined as loose or liquid stools and/or an increase in the frequency of bowel movements (typically at least three in 24 hours) . Acute diarrhea can be accompanied by fever or vomiting, and it usually lasts no more than 7 days. A 2020 Cochrane Review that included 82 RCTs with a total of 12,127 participants (primarily children) reported a reduction of 36% in the risk of diarrhea that lasted 48 hours or more in people who received probiotics compared with those who did not . Probiotics also reduced the mean duration of diarrhea by 21.3 hours. However, the authors noted that there was significant heterogeneity between the included studies, and when they included only studies that had a low risk of bias in their analysis, they found no difference between groups for the risk of diarrhea that lasted 48 hours or more or for the duration of diarrhea. An assessment of 11 RCTs with a total of 2,444 participants showed that LGG is most effective in treating infectious diarrhea at a daily dose of at least 1010 CFU . A review of 22 RCTs and non-randomized trials with a total of 2,440 participants age 1 month to 15 years found that administering Saccharomyces boulardii (most commonly 109 to 1010 CFU/day for 5–10 days) reduced both the duration of diarrhea and stool frequency . In both of these analyses, LGG and Saccharomyces boulardii reduced the duration of acute infectious diarrhea by approximately 1 day. However, two subsequent clinical trials found that a 5-day course of LGG (1 x 1010 CFU twice per day taken alone in one trial and a total of 4 x 109 CFU twice per day of LGG and Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 in the other) was no better than placebo at treating or improving the outcomes of acute gastroenteritis in 1,729 infants and young children who presented to pediatric emergency departments . Recent studies suggest that probiotics might not be efficacious in emergency departments in developed countries because most episodes of acute infectious diarrhea are self-limiting and require no treatment other than rehydration therapy . Therefore, the cost-effectiveness of using probiotic supplements to manage acute viral diarrhea lacks consensus . In 2023, the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) Working Group on Probiotics and Prebiotics issued updated versions of their recommendations for using probiotics to manage specific gastrointestinal disorders in children, including acute gastroenteritis . The Working Group reported that there is evidence that LGG, Saccharomyces boulardii, Limosilactobacillus reuteri, and the combination of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus and Limosilactobacillus reuteri can reduce the duration of diarrhea; therefore, they recommend the use of specific doses and durations of these probiotics in pediatric patients with acute gastroenteritis. However, the grade of recommendation for each of these probiotics was weak, and the certainty of evidence for each was low or very low. In contrast, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) recommended against the use of probiotics in children with acute infectious gastroenteritis in the United States and Canada in their 2020 technical review . In this review, most of the studies that showed a benefit were performed in India, Italy, Poland, Turkey, and Pakistan, and the review authors cited concerns about the risk of bias in these studies. The few studies that were conducted in the United States and Canada reported no benefits. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea Antibiotics can disrupt the intestinal microbiome, and people who are taking antibiotics are at risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Some systematic reviews and meta-analyses report that starting certain probiotic treatments within 2 days of the first antibiotic dose helps reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in specific patient populations. Antibiotics are another common cause of acute-onset diarrhea. By decreasing microbial diversity, antibiotic treatment often disturbs the intestinal microbiome and can lead to a loss of microbial metabolism (resulting in osmotic diarrhea due to excessive fluid in the intestine), loss of colonization resistance (resulting in increased numbers of infections by other pathogens), and increased intestinal motility . Up to 30% of patients who use antibiotics experience AAD . Individuals who are receiving inpatient care are at significantly greater risk of developing AAD than those who are receiving outpatient care. Similarly, children younger than 2 years and seniors older than 65 years are at greater risk of developing AAD than other children and adults. Some antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, penicillin) are associated with AAD more often than others . Meta-analyses indicate that the use of any of a few species and strains of probiotics might reduce the risk of AAD by 51% . However, the benefits of using probiotics to prevent AAD depend on the type of antibiotic that caused the AAD, the strain(s) of probiotic used, the life stage of the user (i.e., child, younger adult, older adult), and whether the user is receiving inpatient or outpatient care. The use of probiotics has been associated with a reduced risk of AAD in children and adults age 18 to 64 years but not in adults age 65 years and older . Both LGG and Saccharomyces boulardii have been shown to reduce the risk of AAD. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 RCTs that included a total of 1,499 children and adults, treatment with 4 x 108 to 12 x 1010 CFU LGG for 10 days to 3 months reduced the risk of AAD in patients who were treated with antibiotics from 22.4% to 12.3% . However, when the 445 children and 1,052 adults were evaluated separately, the difference was only statistically significant in children. Although the optimal dose of LGG is unclear, 1 to 2 x 1010 CFU/day reduced the risk of AAD in children by 71% . Taking probiotics within 2 days of the first antibiotic dose is more effective than starting to take them later. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 RCTs that enrolled a total of 4,780 adults and children (who were mostly between 6 months and 65 years of age), treatment with Saccharomyces boulardii reduced the risk of AAD in adults who were treated with antibiotics from 17.4% to 8.2% when compared with placebo or no treatment . Among the children, Saccharomyces boulardii reduced the risk from 20.9% to 8.8%. Various doses of Saccharomyces boulardii were tested, and no clear dose-dependent effects were observed. A 2023 position paper from the ESPGHAN Working Group on Probiotics and Prebiotics recommends administering doses of 5 x 109 CFU/day or more of LGG or Saccharomyces boulardii starting simultaneously with antibiotics to prevent AAD in nonhospitalized and hospitalized children who have risk factors for AAD, such as the presence of comorbidities . Overall, the available evidence suggests that starting probiotic treatment with LGG or Saccharomyces boulardii within 2 days of the first antibiotic dose helps reduce the risk of AAD in children and adults age 18 to 64. There is no evidence to suggest that the benefits are greater when more than one probiotic strain is used. Necrotizing enterocolitis Researchers have evaluated whether specific combinations of probiotics can reduce the severe inflammatory responses seen in preterm infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Probiotic products are sometimes used in hospital settings to reduce the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has raised concerns that administering probiotics to preterm infants may cause adverse effects. NEC is a life-threatening gastrointestinal illness that mostly affects preterm infants within the first few weeks of birth. NEC occurs when an imbalance in the communities of bacteria in the intestine provokes an inflammatory response from the body; the resulting inflammation can destroy the cells that line the intestine. The risk of NEC is especially high in preterm infants with very low birth weight (i.e., those weighing <1,500 g [3.3 pounds]) . Infants who recover from NEC may have long-lasting health problems, including short bowel syndrome, parenteral nutrition-associated liver injury, and developmental delays. Certain probiotics can block the signaling pathways in the cells of the intestine that respond to bacterial invaders . This can potentially protect the intestine by reducing the inflammatory response. Other probiotics may strengthen the gut barrier, reducing the risk of bacterial translocation and sepsis [40-43]. Thus, researchers have investigated the use of probiotics to prevent NEC in preterm infants, and probiotic products are sometimes used in hospital settings to reduce the risk of NEC [44-46]. In a 2020 AGA technical review, the authors analyzed the results of 63 trials that evaluated the use of single-strain and multi-strain probiotics in a total of 15,712 preterm infants (<37 weeks gestational age) . The review found that administering specific combinations of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains reduced the risk of all-cause mortality, the risk of severe NEC, and the number of days to reach full enteral feeds in these infants when compared with placebo. The results of this review informed AGA’s clinical practice guidelines for probiotics, in which AGA recommends using specific combinations of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains in preterm, low-birth-weight infants to prevent NEC . In addition, the World Health Organization published guidelines in 2023 for the care of preterm or low birth weight infants . Their guidelines state that probiotics may be considered for human-milk-fed preterm infants who are born before 32 weeks gestation. Also in 2023, a systematic review of 90 trials in preterm infants found that multi-strain probiotics reduce the risk of all-cause mortality, severe NEC, and feeding intolerance; multi-strain probiotics also reduce the time needed to reach full enteral feeds and the duration of hospitalization . However, a Cochrane Review stated that the available evidence for using probiotics in very preterm infants born before 32 weeks gestation and very low birth weight infants who weigh less than 1,500 g at birth is inconclusive and called for more research in this population . In their 2023 position paper, the ESPGHAN Working Group on Probiotics and Prebiotics revisited their 2020 recommendations for using probiotics to prevent NEC in preterm infants and concluded that no changes to the 2020 recommendations were needed . They continue to recommend using either LGG (1 to 6 × 109 CFU) or the combination of Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium lactis, and Streptococcus thermophilus (3.0 to 3.5 × 108 CFU for each strain) to reduce the risk of NEC in preterm infants. However, they stated that the grade of this recommendation is weak and the certainty of evidence is low. In addition, they noted that all safety and quality issues must be addressed, such as the potential for probiotic sepsis in preterm infants and the fact that probiotic products might not be labeled with the correct strains . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a news release in 2023 informing the public, including health care providers, that administering probiotics to preterm infants may cause infection or invasive and potentially fatal disease . FDA reported that probiotics have been associated with one infant death and more than two dozen other adverse events in recent years, and the agency reiterated the fact that probiotics have not undergone FDA’s premarket process to evaluate their safety, effectiveness, and quality for medical uses. The agency called for more rigorous clinical trials to provide better evidence for using probiotics in infants. Inflammatory bowel disease Alterations to the gut microbiome may play a role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and researchers are evaluating whether probiotics can help manage this chronic condition. The results have been mixed; studies have reported that certain probiotics might provide some benefits to people with ulcerative colitis but not to those with Crohn’s disease. Clinical practice guidelines do not specifically recommend the use of probiotics in people with IBD. IBD is a chronic inflammatory disease that includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease . The exact cause of IBD is unknown, but it is probably a combination of inherited and environmental factors, including genetic alterations and immune system dysfunction . Various treatments for IBD, including oral steroids and other medications, are available, but no cure exists. Researchers are exploring whether individuals with IBD have alterations in the gut microbiome and whether probiotics might help manage IBD . Several reviews have assessed the effects of probiotics on IBD [31,47,53-56]. The authors of all of these reviews reached similar conclusions—that certain probiotics might have modestly beneficial effects on ulcerative colitis but not Crohn’s disease. A 2020 systematic review from AGA examined the role of probiotics in managing gastrointestinal disorders . The review included 12 trials that used probiotics to induce or maintain remission in 689 children and adults with Crohn’s disease as well as 17 trials that examined the use of various probiotic formulations to induce or maintain remission in 1,673 children and adults with ulcerative colitis. The trials used various probiotic strains and combinations—including Saccharomyces boulardii, LGG, Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC 533, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, and an eight-strain combination product called VSL#3—for several months. The results provided no evidence that probiotics help induce or maintain remission in children or adults with Crohn’s disease. The authors could not draw conclusions about whether probiotics benefit patients with severe ulcerative colitis or are effective alternatives to existing therapies. However, there is some evidence to suggest that these supplements might modestly reduce disease activity in individuals with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis when combined with conventional therapies. The results of this review are limited by the differences between the studies, including different patient populations, probiotic formulations, treatment durations, and concomitant therapies. A 2020 Cochrane Review of 14 studies that enrolled a total of 865 participants with ulcerative colitis also indicated that probiotics may help induce remission and that combining probiotics with 5-ASA (an anti-inflammatory medication commonly used to treat IBD) may be superior to using 5-ASA alone . However, the evidence was limited and of low certainty. A similar 2020 Cochrane Review of 12 studies in 1,473 participants with ulcerative colitis examined whether probiotics can help maintain remission . The authors concluded that the effects of products are uncertain because of the small number of participants in the studies and the unreliable methodologies used. An AGA clinical decision support tool makes no recommendation on the use of probiotics in adults and children with IBD due to knowledge gaps . Similarly, in a clinical practice guideline on the role of probiotics in managing gastrointestinal disorders, AGA recommends using probiotics in adults and children with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease only in the context of a clinical trial . Consensus guidelines published by the British Society of Gastroenterology in 2019 addressed the management of IBD, including the use of probiotics . The authors concluded that although probiotics may be modestly beneficial for people with ulcerative colitis, they should not be routinely used. For people with Crohn’s disease, the authors found no evidence of any benefit. In 2023, the ESPGHAN Working Group on Probiotics and Prebiotics stated that there was not enough evidence to recommend for or against the use of probiotics in children with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease . Additional research, including well-powered RCTs, is needed to identify which patients with IBD might benefit from probiotics and which probiotic strains are most effective . Irritable bowel syndrome In people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), populations of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium decrease as populations of proinflammatory bacterial species increase. Certain probiotic products have the potential to restore some missing microbial functionality and help manage the symptoms of this condition. IBS is a common functional disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that is characterized by recurrent abdominal discomfort or pain, bloating, and changes in stool form or frequency. Although the causes of IBS are not completely understood, growing evidence suggests potential roles for intestinal microbiota in its pathophysiology and symptoms; IBS has also been linked to stress . According to this research, proinflammatory bacterial species, including Enterobacteriaceae, are abundant in patients with IBS, who typically also have a corresponding reduction in the amounts of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in the gastrointestinal tract . Probiotic products commonly contain Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and, therefore, have the potential to restore some missing microbial functionality and, consequently, help manage IBS symptoms. Several meta-analyses have assessed the role of probiotics in patients with IBS [62-66]. Most have found that probiotics have a positive, although modest, beneficial effect. For example, a meta-analysis of 23 RCTs in a total of 2,575 patients found that, overall, probiotics reduced the risk that IBS symptoms would persist or not improve by 21% . Various species and strains of probiotics had beneficial effects on global IBS symptoms, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence scores, but the quality of the studies was low. Some combinations of probiotics were superior to individual strains in this analysis, but no specific combination was superior to another. A second meta-analysis of 15 RCTs in a total of 1,793 patients with IBS found that probiotics reduced the severity of overall symptoms and abdominal pain more than placebo after 8 to 10 weeks of therapy; in children, these supplements also improved mucosal barrier function . A more recent systematic review included 35 RCTs of 16 single-strain and 19 multi-strain products in 3,406 adults with IBS . Of the studies that found a statistically significant reduction in global symptoms (14 of 29 trials) or a clinically meaningful reduction in abdominal pain (8 of 34 trials), most used multi-strain probiotic products. Furthermore, only trials of multi-strain products found a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life . Whether different strains of probiotic bacteria have beneficial effects in people with IBS probably depends on the IBS symptom being evaluated . In a meta-analysis of 10 RCTs that enrolled a total of 877 adults who were treated with probiotics or placebo for 4 weeks to 6 months, people who received probiotics that contained Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium longum, or Lactobacillus acidophilus species had lower pain scores than those who received placebo . In contrast, Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and Saccharomyces boulardii had no significant effect. Flatulence declined with the use of all tested probiotics, and the abdominal distension scores improved with the use of probiotics that contained Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus plantarum species. The authors noted that, overall, the studies showed no clear positive effect of probiotics on quality of life. The available evidence indicates that probiotics might reduce some symptoms of IBS. However, additional high-quality clinical trials are needed to confirm the specific strain, dose, and duration of treatment required as well as the type of IBS (such as with predominant diarrhea or constipation) that can be treated effectively with probiotics. Hypercholesterolemia Some studies have suggested that taking combinations of certain probiotic strains may improve lipid profiles. Specifically, the use of specific probiotics may reduce total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, study results have been mixed, and more research is needed. High levels of cholesterol in the blood or cholesterol trapped in arterial walls are risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries cholesterol to tissues and arteries. The higher the LDL level, the greater the risk is for CVD. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) carries cholesterol from the tissues to the liver and leads to its excretion. A low level of HDL increases a person’s risk of CVD. Researchers have studied the use of probiotics to improve lipid profiles. The mechanisms of their effects on cholesterol concentrations include catabolism of cholesterol by increasing: • Bile salt hydrolase activity, which increases the need for new bile acids and thus reduces serum cholesterol levels [70-72] • The binding of cholesterol in the small intestine, which reduces the amount that the body absorbs • The assimilation and incorporation of cholesterol into bacteria , thus lowering cholesterol levels in blood • The production of short-chain fatty acids by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, which lowers hepatic cholesterol synthesis and regulates cholesterol metabolism [70-73] A meta-analysis of 30 RCTs with 1,624 participants (mostly adults age 18 years or older) found that administering probiotics for 3 to 12 weeks reduced total cholesterol concentrations by a mean of 7.8 mg/dL and reduced LDL concentrations by a mean of 7.3 mg/dL compared with placebo . In subgroup analyses, the benefits of probiotics were slightly greater in studies that lasted 8 weeks or longer and in participants who had baseline total cholesterol levels higher than 240 mg/dL. Among the strains included in more than three studies, Lactobacillus acidophilus, a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis, and Lactobacillus plantarum were associated with significant reductions in total and LDL cholesterol concentrations, but Lactobacillus helveticus and Enterococcus faecium were not. In a smaller meta-analysis of 11 RCTs in 602 adults with normal or high cholesterol levels, those treated with probiotics for 2 to 10 weeks had 6.6 mg/dL lower total cholesterol and 8.5 mg/dL lower LDL cholesterol levels than those treated with placebo, but the probiotic treatment had no significant effects on HDL cholesterol levels . The effects were most pronounced in people who consumed probiotics for more than 4 weeks, in those with hypercholesterolemia, and in those age 45 or older. In both meta-analyses, participants included both healthy adults and adults with hypercholesterolemia, CVD, diabetes, or obesity. However, the authors of a more recent review of the influence of probiotics on the blood lipid profiles of healthy adults (in 14 studies with a total of 942 adults treated for 15–150 days) found insufficient evidence to conclude that probiotics improve blood lipid levels . Another review found that the use of probiotics that contained multiple strains produced statistically significant reductions in total and LDL cholesterol levels (by 12.0 and 20.1 mg/dL, respectively), whereas trials that used a single strain did not . Overall, research suggests that using a combination of multiple probiotic strains as well as probiotics that contain Lactobacillus acidophilus, a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis, or Lactobacillus plantarum might reduce total and LDL cholesterol levels. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings. Obesity The microbes of the intestinal tract help extract nutrients and energy from food, which suggests a role for probiotics in the management of body weight. However, while some of the clinical trials that have evaluated the impact of probiotics on obesity-related endpoints have reported promising results, others have reported no effects. The gut microbiota play an important role in nutrient and energy extraction from food. Research in mice suggests that the gut microbiota affect not only the use of energy from the diet, but also energy expenditure and storage within the host . Whether these effects translate to humans is unknown. The results of clinical trials that have assessed the impact of probiotics on obesity-related endpoints have been inconsistent. One 12-week clinical trial, for example, randomized 210 healthy adults age 35 to 60 years who had large amounts of visceral fat to consume 200 g/day of fermented milk that contained 107, 106, or 0 (control) CFU of Lactobacillus gasseri SBT2055 (LG2055) per gram of milk . Participants who received 107 or 106 CFU/g milk of Lactobacillus gasseri experienced significant reductions in visceral fat area (mean reductions of 8.5% and 8.2%, respectively), body mass index, waist and hip circumference, and body fat mass compared with the control group. In an RCT, daily supplementation with 3.24 x 108 CFU Lactobacillus rhamnosus CGMCC1.3724 for 24 weeks combined with an energy-restricted diet for the first 12 weeks (500 kcal/day less than estimated calorie needs) did not significantly affect weight loss compared with placebo in 125 adults with obesity . However, among female participants, those who received Lactobacillus had greater reductions in body weight after 12 weeks (loss of 1.8 kg) and 24 weeks (loss of 2.6 kg) than those who received placebo. A 2017 systematic review of 14 clinical trials, including the two described above, in 1,067 individuals with overweight or obesity showed that probiotics (mostly Lactobacillus administered at various doses for 3 weeks to 6 months) significantly decreased body weight and/or body fat in nine trials, had no effect in three trials, and increased body weight in two trials . Another recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 RCTs in 957 individuals with overweight or obesity found that supplementation with various doses and strains of probiotics for 3 to 12 weeks resulted in larger reductions in body weight (by 0.6 kg), body mass index (by 0.27 kg/m2), and fat percentage (by 0.6%) than placebo . However, these effects were small and of questionable clinical significance. In contrast, a more recent systematic review and meta-analysis, which included 19 randomized trials in 1,412 participants, found that supplementation with probiotics or synbiotics reduced waist circumference slightly (by 0.82 cm) but had no effect on body weight or body mass index, although the quality of evidence was low to moderate . The findings from another meta-analysis of 14 trials in 881 adults, 5 trials in 726 children, and 12 trials in 1,154 infants suggested that probiotics promote the loss of a mean of 0.54 kg in adults, the gain of a mean of 0.20 kg in children, and no significant weight loss or gain in infants . Taken together, these results indicate that the effects of probiotics on body weight and obesity might depend on several factors, including the probiotic strain, dose, and duration, as well as certain characteristics of the user, including age, sex, and baseline body weight. Additional research is needed to understand the potential effects of probiotics on body fat, body weight, and obesity in humans. Safety Considerations Probiotics are unlikely to cause harm in healthy people, and side effects are usually minor. However, the use of probiotics has been linked to a few cases of bacteremia, fungemia, and infections that have resulted in severe illness; most of these cases involved individuals who were severely ill or immunocompromised. Many probiotic strains derive from species with a long history of safe use in foods or from microorganisms that colonize healthy gastrointestinal tracts. For these reasons, common probiotics—such as Bifidobacterium and members of the Lactobacillaceae family—are unlikely to cause harm in healthy people . Side effects of probiotics are usually minor and consist of self-limited gastrointestinal symptoms, such as gas. However, some clinical trials of probiotics are not designed to adequately address questions about safety, leaving gaps in available safety evidence [85-87]. Moreover, some evidence indicates that probiotics may cause harm in certain populations, including people who are severely ill or immunocompromised. The 2023 FDA press release discussed above expressed concerns about the potential risks of administering probiotics to preterm infants . The use of probiotics has been linked to bacteremia, fungemia (fungi in the blood), or infections that have resulted in severe illness in some cases, most of which involved individuals who were severely ill or immunocompromised . However, some case reports did not confirm that the specific strain of probiotics used was the cause of the infection. In other cases, the probiotic strain was confirmed to be the opportunistic pathogen. Because the species used as probiotics can also be normal residents of a patient’s microbiota, such confirmation is important. At least 60 reports have been published since 1966 of fungemia associated with the use of probiotics that contain the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In many of these cases, the patients were in an intensive care unit (ICU), were receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition, had a central venous catheter, or had received broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment . When LGG was introduced into dairy products in Finland in 1990, monitoring of this country’s population through 2000 revealed no increase in the rates of bacteremia (bacteria in the blood) caused by Lactobacillus species . However, a retrospective analysis of 22,174 ICU patients in a Boston hospital found that those who received LGG (typically through a feeding tube) had a markedly higher risk of developing Lactobacillus bacteremia compared to patients who did not receive the probiotic . Of the 522 patients who received LGG, a genome-level analysis identified six cases where the ingested LGG was found in the blood, compared to only two cases among the 21,652 patients who did not receive the LGG. For individuals with compromised immune function or other serious underlying diseases, the World Gastroenterology Organisation (WGO) advises restricting probiotic use to the strains and indications that have proven efficacy Probiotic Selection and Use There are currently no formal recommendations for or against the use of probiotics in healthy people. However, some expert bodies of health professionals provide guidance on the use of specific probiotic strains in people with certain health conditions. These groups also offer guidance for clinicians and consumers on choosing probiotic products. Expert bodies of health professionals make no recommendations for or against the use of probiotics by healthy people. For people with various health conditions, however, published studies and reviews provide some guidance (as described above) on probiotic species, strains, and doses that might alleviate their symptoms. The WGO notes that the optimal dose of probiotics depends on the strain and product and recommends that clinicians only advise their patients to use probiotic strains, doses, and durations that have been shown to be beneficial in human studies . The WGO guidelines include a summary of the evidence on specific probiotic strains used in studies for specific gastrointestinal endpoints . Finally, the WGO recommends that probiotic supplement users check the labels of probiotic supplements for recommended storage conditions; for example, some require refrigeration, whereas others can be stored at room temperature. The International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics advises manufacturers to list the total number of CFU—ideally for each strain—through the expiration date or use-by date on the product label . The association also suggests that consumers of these supplements avoid products that list the number of CFU at time of manufacture because this information does not account for declines in CFU over a product’s lifespan."
